Skyler,Hwa Chong Institution,2021,A,"Hong Kong no doubt boasts some of the wealthiest individuals the world has seen, with bustling tourist hotspots packed with branded stores. If one was to walk further down the streets of Hong Kong, the scene is no longer one of bustling commerce, painted in the glow of billboards and shop signs, but one of the sprawling and towering patches of grey and black. For many Hong Kongers, this is their life – cage homes, unsanitary living conditions, a stagnant minimum wage despite escalating living costs, and no promise of job security. Prosperity concerns itself with the creation of a wealth of individuals and the strong economic growth of the country. It would be mendacious to claim that prosperity is the be-all and end-all of society, as inclusive growth, the fulfillment of international obligations, and the safeguard of social wellbeing are all priorities that should not be second fiddle to economic gains. Inclusive growth is a priority that is necessary for building an equitable and ideal social foundation for prosperity to be meaningful. Economic growth has almost always come at the cost of a widening rich-poor divide. The growth of large corporations disproportionately benefits a country’s economy, whereas individuals of lower strata struggle to stay afloat as corporate tactics of offshoring and automating manufacturing threaten their livelihoods. This goes against the fundamental goal of prosperity, which should be that economic growth benefits all. In China, the exponential economic growth since the economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping in 1978 obscured alarmingly severe rural-urban disparities. While China’s economy is second only to the United States, a historical powerhouse, its Gini coefficient is consistently above 0.4, beyond the internationally recognised warning level. The discrepancy between disposable incomes of well-developed cities and underdeveloped cities populated by ethnic minorities is also concerning, with Shanghai’s GDP being more than 4 times higher than Tibet’s. Such inequality has disastrous repercussions on society as the working class grows increasingly disillusioned and tensions between the lower and upper echelons of society intensify. “Killing the rich” has taken a literal toll on Chinese society, as the murders of tycoons such as Li Haicang have become an increasingly common phenomenon. In the Western world, the rise of the alternative right, the election of Donald Trump, and the decision to leave in the Brexit referendum are all, in part, products of such inequality. Inclusive growth should be just as important as prosperity to ensure that all individuals benefit, and nobody is left behind. Secondly, governments should not place fulfilling international obligations secondary to achieving prosperity. Specifically, the prosperity of a country should not be exploitative of other countries or come above providing aid. International cooperation is crucial in safeguarding international peace and works on the fundamental shared values of humanity that bind all of mankind together. Countries should hence emphasise protecting humanity. It is in this vein that countries should not prioritise individual prosperity over this international obligation. Countries, particularly big economic players, should not let their prosperity be predicated upon the exploitation of other countries. This problematic trend can be observed through companies such as H&M and Apple using sweatshops in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and China, and through military tactics, such as the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, where the US’ ulterior motive was to gain from rich oil fields in the Middle East. Any gains from these deeds are inherently unethical, as they benefit countries significantly more than the individuals they exploited. The deaths of countless Iraqis and the following instability the US brought to the Middle East can never be reversed, as lives were shattered and futures desecrated. Providing aid in times of need should additionally come above the economic gains of a country. Protecting the vulnerable should always be at the forefront of the international community. It is in line with this principle that the UK substantially slashing aid to Yemen amidst the COVID-19 pandemic has caused countries to call the UK’s commitment to international humanitarian responses into question. When the choice is between the lives of the vulnerable and long-term gains in one’s economic status, the former should remain the priority. Thirdly, protecting the social well-being of individuals should not be secondary to prosperity. Intangible aspects of society, such as mental health, happiness, social safety nets like welfare systems, and social harmony, are all necessary to building a healthy society. These attributes enable individuals to achieve self-actualisation, and lead dignified lives. These expand the value of human life beyond acting solely as units of economic utility. Once a country is sufficiently prosperous, such that they are not in danger of having most of society being unable to attain basic standards of living, prosperity should no longer take precedence over these intangible social aspects. Governments have an inherent duty of care, as demonstrated through governments mandating off-days for workers, providing maternity and paternity leave for parents, even if they compromise on economic productivity. The extension of that principle is to say that governments should protect what makes human life dignified to protect citizens from abuse and exploitation. This would reflect what we see in Bhutan, where most individuals lead healthy lives and while not having an outstanding level of GDP, has been named the happiest country in the world many times. Bhutan also has one of the most stable ecosystems in the world and strong preservation of its cultural identity. This can be contrasted with Singapore, which, while boasting an impressive economic status, is notorious for being one of the most burnt-out populations, being named the second most overworked city in the world. While Singaporeans have no doubt higher living standards, the sacrifice of the Singaporean population is their ability to lead as meaningful and happy a life as the Bhutanese. This elucidates the necessity of governments to not neglect social wellbeing in the name of pursuing prosperity. Proponents of the view that prosperity is all that matters would point to the fact that prosperity is indubitably beneficial to society, insofar that individuals on average enjoy higher standards of living, such as greater access to sanitary living conditions, better social amenities, and so forth. Arguments have also been put forth to suggest that more prosperous nations can do better at correcting social inequality, as there is more money for redistribution. This is through direct government intervention, or through the ‘trickle-down effect’. What we see in today’s world, however, directly contradicts the aforementioned argumentation. For countries that place prosperity above social equity, such as the US and China, have significant social inequality to this day despite efforts to equitably redistributive wealth. The political and economic incentive to prioritise wealth generation in the system by pandering to wealthier individuals or large conglomerates will always outweigh protecting the vulnerable. This starkly contrasts with countries that prioritise equality over prosperity, or view them to be of equal importance. Countries like Norway or Finland exhibit this, where a high personal tax is collected to facilitate better social support, in terms of the provision of public services such as healthcare and education, and generous welfare schemes to protect the vulnerable in society. Countries that historically prioritise prosperity find it impossible to achieve what Norway and Finland achieve, as their decision-making calculus and incentive structures are too deeply rooted in the pursuit of economic gains. Hence, such prosperity does little in correcting social inequality in the long run. Make no mistake, prosperity is not a bad thing. The condition to make prosperity a meaningful tool to benefit society, in general, is inclusive growth. In the absence of this, prosperity can quickly enslave vulnerable individuals and shackle them to decades of economic slavery. Countries must not misplace their priorities and similarly focus on upholding their fundamental principles and duties to the international community, and the societies they govern. Only then can society become one that is truly equitable, and one that fights to protect even the most vulnerable. Prosperity is not all that matters.",‘Prosperity is all that matters; everything else can take a back seat.’ Do you agree?
Skyler,Hwa Chong Institution,2021,A,"Freedom of speech is, to the Western world, a principal human right that must be protected by the law. Yet, to the Asian world, the freedom of speech is much less absolute, subject to the regulation of the state. Does the freedom of speech supersede other rights? Does it supersede social cohesion? Freedom of speech is no doubt an important tool, but it should not come at a cost that society is not ready to bear. Crucially, freedom of speech should be protected to the extent that it does not cause grievous harm to society. Freedom of speech is not an absolute right and should be denied in certain circumstances when it is abused. It should be protected in most instances, but where it facilitates egregious harm against society, spreads misinformation, and particularly hurts the vulnerable, such free speech no longer has a place in society. Firstly, free speech can potentially cause grievous harm to society. In today’s polarised world, voices are becoming more strident, anti-establishment culls dominate socio-political discussions. People are becoming more vocal, particularly voices of dissent. In itself, that is not a bad thing. The problem arises when the amplification of these voices emboldens problematic subsets of ‘free speech’, such as hate speech. Hate speech is particularly pernicious because it is sectarian in nature, driving wedges between groups of people, and can prove an incredibly divisive force. Social unity is therefore threatened and can rip apart the social fabric. The unrest that would subsequently ensue is sufficiently egregious a harm for such speech to be denied. Speech that incites such divisiveness has been rejected by society and governments. Donald Trump’s role in the Capitol storming aptly reflects this. His ‘free speech’ rallied together extremist and radical right-wing Trump supporters, who fought not only to reverse the democratic process but push forth white supremacy amongst other conservative ideals. The abuse of such free speech for individual gain on Trump’s part cost massive wastage in taxpayer dollars, the loss of innocent lives, and many minorities to live in fear. Arguably, the bigoted ideas of these supporters already existed. Yet, the crucial difference here is that certain expressions of free speech embolden individuals to act on their impulses, threatening social stability. It is in this vein that Twitter banned Trump from its platform indefinitely, and the Senate brought forth impeachment charges against Trump. This highlights that our society and legal systems, as much as they try to defend free speech, prioritise social unity and security first. Secondly, unrestricted free speech is a breeding ground for the proliferation of fake news. Fake news has been the concern of governments across the world in the last few years. Misinformation causes public fear, undermines government legitimacy, and often causes undue stress in society. Understandably, it would be mendacious to characterise all fake news as insidious in nature and created to cause harm. Many cases do arise where the fake news does not accrue significant social cost and was shared by innocent and unknowing individuals. This, however, does not discount that there is a group of individuals who will frivolously create misinformation for perverse enjoyment and the pursuit of selfish gains, abusing the protection we grant to the freedom of speech. Given that these individuals often disseminate the most attention-grabbing fake news, the extent of their impact could be massive and such freedom of speech must therefore be denied in such cases. The lack of regulation of fake news in the West proved costly in their COVID-19 pandemic fight, elucidating why such free speech ought to be restricted. The West, particularly the US, was plagued by relentless vaccine misinformation and other COVID conspiracies. Take for example QAnon which was incredibly vocal in its conspiracy claims that COVID was a ploy to keep Trump out of the office and not a true threat to society. Even if considering the view that QAnon is an anomaly, incidents of fake news cause significant vaccine hesitancy and skepticism toward government institutions. Opposition to such restrictions may argue that these large-scale crises are rare, but crucially, this lack of regulation presents a slippery slope and sets a precedent that cannot be reversed sufficiently quickly in times of crises. Free speech therefore should not be protected in such cases. Freedom of speech should additionally be denied when it particularly hurts the vulnerable. Race of religion centric hate speech, the speech of a sexual nature toward minors in an attempt to solicit sexual favours, phishing and doxxing, among other sorts of speech, are prohibited by most states. As important as free speech may be, we must recognise that there are vulnerable individuals whom the state ought to protect. For example, they include children who are not rationally able to consent in most scenarios, the mentally handicapped, and racial-religious minorities who generally suffer microaggressions and lack the social, economic, and political capital to defend themselves. In these cases, these groups often cannot fight back or are disproportionately hurt, which the state must stand against. This restriction to free speech has been observed globally and is indicative of each state’s prioritisation of the safety of the vulnerable. For example, the penal code 298A in Singapore and Article 10 in the United Kingdom’s Human Rights Act of 1998 all put forth caveats to free speech that specifically protect minorities. The harsher laws to deter crime against children, such as section 2442(b) of Title 18 in the United States, is yet another reflection of state priorities. Such restrictions are hence principally aligned with state and social values and should be enforced. Some may claim, conversely, that free speech is an a priori good and is crucial to self-actualisation. The underlying logic is that individuals can only live their best lives in the most meaningful way at the point where they have absolute freedom of speech. For example, individuals can engage in meaningful discourse when they can speak freely without fear of backlash, and can openly actualise their identity however they wish. Free speech is also necessary for the exchange of ideas which help inform an individual’s conception of social norms, as well as their standing relative to their society. Self-actualisation is important as it is the most individual and personal way in which a person can give value to their existence, which is crucial in leading a dignified life. I would posit, however, that self-actualisation is not dependent on the freedom of speech, and can be accessed through many other means such as one’s talents of interest. Even if the freedom of speech is crucial to self-actualisation, the point at which we deny the freedom of speech is when it causes significant harm to society. Such speech is not the basis of an identity that the state should protect, insofar that the intentions are malicious. On balance, the right for minorities to function without the feat of bigotry in every waking moment, the right for children to be safe against predators, the right for citizens to live in a stable society that allows them to pursue their self-actualisation, cumulatively override the ability for a bigoted minority to self-actualise. There is no hesitancy that should arise in making such a trade-off. Note, however, that there is a difference between hate and discriminatory speech. All hate speech is discriminatory, but not all discriminatory speech is hate speech. Crucially, the intent must be considered in determining the nature of the speech. Any true threat to safety and intention to harm must be silenced. This is not a world where free speech is silenced at all costs; do make no mistake of that. Dissent is valid and protected. Recognise that in most cases, protecting society and the vulnerable will not come at the cost of free speech. But when push comes to shove, protect the citizens and protect the vulnerable. A privileged white male can be vocal, openly expressing his bigotry through loudspeakers, and call it self-actualisation. But to the young Muslim girl who fears for her life walking home at night, for the single African-American mother who struggles to feed her children even on food stamps, for the refugee who lives in constant fear that he will once again be thrust into the unforgiving torment of fleeing from home, his free speech is much more than just words. His speech is not speech we should protect. Deny free speech when it is abused.",Do you agree that freedom of speech should never be denied even though it can be abused?
Skyler,Hwa Chong Institution,2021,A,"Since time immemorial, humanity has been plagued by violence, from the barbaric, ruthless slavery imposed by colonial masters, to the unstable geopolitical scene before us today with war and terror never too far away. Violence exists on a spectrum and can be physical, emotional, or mental, taking many forms such as war, abuse, and bullying. In their formative years, as children are trying to make sense of their identity and the world around them, growing up exposed to violence is particularly pernicious. The world will eventually come to pay the price as children become pawns for extremist groups, significantly more predisposed to violence or apathetic to violence. Children who grow up exposed to violence tend to be more easily swayed by extremist ideologies and often become pawns for terrorist organisations. On one hand, children growing up in war-torn areas tend to be directly exposed to extremist ideology. Having lived in fear and constant instability since young, many children do not view extremist groups as a threat, but rather as their protection from evil that conflict brings. Cognisant of the vulnerability of these children, extremist groups often promise protection from adversaries, the provision of basic necessities, and a sense of community. Many children and youths are hence recruited from war-torn regions to fight for extremist groups. Their constant exposure to violence makes them even more effective as soldiers as their sense of normalcy has been severely warped. During the 2003 Iraq war, the Islamic State (ISIS) found itself incredibly successful in recruiting child soldiers from war-torn Iraq as it promised to fight for Iraq from the invasion of the Americans, and not just food and a place to stay, but also to take care of their families as they fought for ISIS. On the other hand, minorities overseas who are faced with discrimination and violence in their home countries do not feel a sense of belonging and in turn develop a sense of resentment towards their home countries and a desperate need for a sense of community. For many years, ISIS was able to recruit teenage soldiers from Europe, particularly from countries such as France, which were strongly secular and denied the expressions of faith from Muslims which their religion conversely required. This strengthened ISIS’ presence in the Western world and particularly manipulated child soldiers for roles such as suicide bombers as they tended not to be viewed as threatening to others. As a result, many innocent lives were lost globally and fear gripped many nations as they desperately tried to combat the violent forces of terrorism. Children who grew up exposed to violence in the form of domestic violence or bullying tend to be more predisposed to violence in the future. For decades, psychologists have warned of the harms of abuse and mental health disorders, ranging from mood disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to dissociative personality disorders. Children who grew up exposed to such violence tend to harbor a deep sense of insecurity, anger and fear. It becomes problematic as such violent tendencies fester unchecked through adolescence and these individuals inflict violence upon others as an outlet to cope with their pain and trauma, or simply for revenge. Many notorious serial killers such as Ed Gein, John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy, and Charles all have something in common – they were abused as children. According to a Federal Report from the United States Secret Service, the majority of school shooters were victims of bullying in their adolescence. Such violent crimes strike fear internationally as people attempt to grapple with the horrific reality of the depths of darkness that the human mind can possess. Such crimes cause widespread fear as people fear for their safety. While such crimes might be more prevalent in certain countries, it happens in every part of the world. In less extreme cases, such violence causes children to grow up having problems such as trust and abandonment issues, inflicting a similar degree of harm on their own children in the future, causing an unending cycle of hurt and pain, which could lead to deep trauma for many societies in future. Furthermore, as children grow up witnessing violence, apathy towards such violence festers, which could cause social regression in the future. As stories after stories of violence and war are plastered across the news and shared over social media, individuals become desensitised to violence. Children, in particular, become numb to seeing such violence as they have become accustomed to hearing such stories since a young. From the various refugee crises in the mid-2010s, the alleged torture of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, the Burmese military coup, the assassination of Soleimani, the Abu Ghraib tortures in Iraq, to the 2021 Israel-Palestine crisis, children are no stranger to witnessing violence. Particularly with the burgeoning growth of social media, children are exposed to violence at an increasingly young age. Photos of gruesome violence such as lifeless bodies of refugee children washed ashore and corpses with bullet wounds going viral have become common occurrences with every conflict. Such atrocities no longer induce the same level of indignation and moral outrage as fatigue, helplessness, and apathy set in. Psychologists and humanitarians in the United Kingdom lament that the mainstream media is simply no longer able to humanise refugees because of the oversaturation of the media with tragic, violent news, amplifying the apathy amongst the Britons. Given existing trends, there is no telling how much further society will regress in terms of responding to humanitarian crises as apathetic children grow to be leaders of the future. Global humanity will eventually pay the ultimate price for such apathy. Conversely, some may argue that the world, in fact, does not pay the price. Rather, it is the underprivileged communities that will pay the ultimate price for their children to grow up being exposed to violence. For the most extreme cases of violence, the individuals affected most immediately are not the children in the developed West with slight behavioural issues from exposure to violent video games for too long, but the refugee child who suffers intense PTSD from having his homeland bombed, having to flee in boats to other countries only to be turned away or having to see his family torn away from him at refugee centres. The sheer extent of harm is far worse in the poorer, war-torn societies than in richer, privileged parts of the world. While murders and abuse do happen, their impact on society is far less than a war. The fear that arises after a terrorist attack may be imminent, but to live every day in fear for your life is not a gut-wrenching experience most will understand. Even the cost of apathy is paid mostly by the refugees and the oppressed as they fight for their lives. While that may be true, and the price paid is disproportionate, I would posit that the world still pays the price as such underprivileged individuals belong to collective global humanity. The suffering of these individuals is no less a loss to the global community. I would further argue that even though in an absolute sense, the hurt to the privileged parts of the world might be less, but pain and hurt are subjective. The fear that arises in the aftermath of a violent conflict and crisis is rarer, but it impacts people symmetrically as it serves as a painful reminder that nobody is truly safe from the evil of humanity. In the aftermath of the Columbine, Sandy Hook, and Stoneman Douglas High School school shootings, intense grief was felt not only by the communities affected but the entire nation. Following the 2021 River Valley High School murder in Singapore, the fear, confusion, and hurt among the nation was palpable. The suffering of one cannot simply be undermined by being compared to the pain felt by another. All individuals all suffer in various capacities, everyone is paying a price of his or her own, causing the price that is paid to be very much global in nature. Growing up exposed to violence has become a regrettable, but undeniable, aspect of childhood today. Growing up either directly bearing the burden of violence or facing the burden of helplessness when witnessing the globally evident pandemic of violence, our children today will grow up bearing such a weight that they will never be able to shake. And as the world has shown children no mercy and exposed them to this violence, the world will come to pay the ultimate price for its violence.","‘When children grow up exposed to violence, the world will pay the price.” Discuss."
Junwei,Hwa Chong Institution,2020,36,"The 2020 U.S. Presidential Election seemed to defy all previous political norms. The incumbent seeking a second term, Donald Trump, treated the dignity and credibility of his office with utter disregard, posting and sharing fake news stories that included assertions that Obama was born in Kenya or that Biden had dementia, from both his private and public social media accounts. Despite this, he came within 42000 votes of securing another term, out of more than 100 million cast. It seems that the conventional wisdom regarding trust and governance is no longer valid, and that a government could possibly be able to stay in power even if it loses the trust of the people. Given technological advancements allowing a greater degree of information control and the rise of political polarisation, while a government that loses trust might suffer electorally, it is by no means guaranteed to fail. The most direct way a loss of trust from the people damages the government’s standing is through slumping electoral fortunes. As citizens no longer believe the government is accountable or honest in the intentions of its legislation, it would be natural for citizens to seek a replacement. After all, are honestly and accountability not the most valued virtues in public service, where so much is at stake? That was the case, for example in the 2008 Presidential Election in Taiwan. Sitting president Chen Shui Bian’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) had been in power for 8 years, but those 8 years had seen an unbroken string of corruption allegations against high-ranking ministers, including Chen himself. Voters’ trust of Chen’s government was at an all-time low and to no one’s surprise, the DPP was swept out in 2008, losing the presidency and their majorities in Parliament. However, just because Chen’s government was defeated in a landslide does not mean it was a complete failure. An electoral failure, perhaps, but slipping in the opinion polls did not prevent Chen from continuing to push through legislation, from broadening democratic reforms in what was then still a young democracy, launching further investments into computer technologies that gave Taiwanese companies a slice of the pie in lucrative industries like image processors or chip manufacturing. It is naive to suggest that garnering popular support is the only measure of a government’s success and even if a government’s poll numbers slide due to to a major scandal, it does not destroy their ability to govern and render them ineffective. Although it must be conceded that a government who has lost trust may find it harder to have the people accept its policies as legitimate, such effects are ephemeral and have little bearing when policies see fruition in the future, where any scandal is likely forgotten. Overall, a loss in trust might reduce a government’s ability to govern, but does not mean it will definitely fail at governing, despite the electoral implications. Another way governments can remain in power if it cannot gain the people’s trust is by stifling dissent. Although democracy is the prevalent form of government in today’s world, let us not forget that autocracies nonetheless persist. In such places, the concept of press freedom or freedom of expression is laughable. Without such liberties, even if a government loses trust of the people, the dissidents are unable to coordinate in public via protests or uprisings of the sort. As such, there is little avenue for the government to be punished for its ‘trust-losing actions’, as the traditional way of doing so, via elections, has been gutted. Do North Koreans have faith in their government? Hard to tell, given the amount of brainwashing they face on a daily basis, but likely not, given how their standards of living have stagnated at Third World levels, with starvation and poverty a feature of daily life for many. However, some might argue that being able to remain in power does not mean a government is not a failure. Instead, it is contended that such governments have failed to be deemed credible and lost its position of legitimacy, which could be the greatest failure of all, to fail to be recognised by the people. But it is difficult to prove that such an impression can last. Citizens are fickle, poorly-informed for the most part and have an irritating habit of ‘forgiveness’. Putin, the Russian President, has been in power for a decade and the protests against him and his anti-democratic regime, most recently over the imprisonment of opposition leader Navalny. But such protests have come and gone, yet Putin is still there. The Russian people seem just as concerned about the economy as human rights, as the protests seem to always coincide with periods of economic downturn or drops in price of oil, a major export. As long as Putin keeps the economy going strong, his approval ratings and trust numbers go up. The conclusion from this is that any loss of trust is not permanent and governments can recover and are not doomed to fail if they have lost trust. Finally, the rise in partisanship has also made it more difficult for governments to fail even if it is deemed untrustworthy. Essentially, people might just stop caring about credibility and more about politics. That is the trend of increased partisanship seen in some parts of the world, where voting for the party of one’s views is more important than voting for the candidate with better character (who is therefore more likely to win trust). Such political tribalism means that losing or winning the people’s trust becomes less relevant to governance, as a government’s legitimacy, credibility and electoral support becomes tied to how many conservatives and liberals answer opinion polls and vote, not politicians’ character. A concerning example of this was in the 2019 UK General Election where Prime Minister Boris Johnson handily beat Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, even though Corbyn’s trustworthiness, according to some polls, was 30 percentage points higher. In the aftermath of Brexit, Corbyn’s pro-EU stance was simply a bad read of the public mood and too much to bear for many swing voters, causing them to support Johnson, who was determined to see Brexit through. It did not matter whether voters believed Johnson was truthful. They only cared who was for Brexit, which happened to be Johnson, who went on to win the election. Voters put too much stake into their own political opinions for peripheral factors like trust to influence their vote at all in these cases, leading governments who might not be seen as trustworthy to continue to govern due to essentially blind support from the people. Regardless of increased political polarisation, or attempts to stifle dissent, it should be agreed that losing trust is not a good thing to happen to any government. Electoral losses, the most direct way for citizens’ displeasure to be heard, are still incurred for most governments and even though Trump only lost 42000 or so votes, he still lost. The ultimate punishment for politicians – losing power, while not the defining factor to whether a government is a failure or not, is still significant.",A government that fails to win the trust of the people is doomed to fail. Comment
Junwei,Hwa Chong Institution,2020,35/50,"In the aftermath of the Second World War, the victorious allies came together to establish the United Nations (UN). Its primary objective was to prevent another armed conflict of similar scale from ever happening again. But in the decades that followed, armed conflict persisted and in certain cases the U.N. not only did not condemn it, but instead actively engaged in it, such as the invasion of Iraq and the Korean War. Indeed, despite a global movement to promote peace and civility, violence retains is applications in today’s world, mainly as a last resort, and its limited use is sanctioned by the government and within societal norms when dealing with unsavoury parties. The use of violence in situations where there are more peaceful alternatives, is generally not accepted by governments or society at-large. Although the blunt application of force can easily allow one to achieve their intended outcome in conflict, its downsides are numerous. Firstly, it grants the winner only a tenuous victory, for the defeated party is likely to bear residual resentment, especially after being subjected to grievous personal injury. As such, it is not uncommon to see the defeated party rebel after the forces of the victor are gone. The Crimean conflict is one such example. Even after the unlawful Russian annexation of Crimea, surviving guerilla Ukrainian forces continue to cause trouble for the Russian army, making their military success an unstable and potentially short-lived one. For the reason the effectiveness of violence is often doubted and governments usually do not sanction military action when a long-term solution to preserve stability is still possible. Secondly, violence is against cultural norms of many countries, due to the sheer bloodshed and havoc it can unleash. Generations of influential philosophers and thinkers have concluded that, any advantages of violence are outweighed by the collateral damage it can cause, physically and mentally, not just to the parties involved but also to their friends and families. For example, Confucius’ philosophy centres around compassion and love and condemns violence of any sort. Similar ideas are found in major religions as well. One of Jesus Christ’s main teachings is that of peace and to prevent conflict at all costs, even when it means great personal sacrifice. These cultural and religious influences contribute to society’s general aversion towards violence and feature in political decision-making, often making leaders re-evaluate violent actions before giving them the green light, for fear of public backlash. However, it is a whole different ballgame when all peaceful alternatives have been exhausted. Violence is still recognised as an acceptable means to an end when it is the only option remaining. For example, when police are dealing with a hostage situation, gunfire only begins when negotiations fail to make progress and the hostage’s life is at risk. This has been standard procedure and was exactly what happened when terrorists opened fire in a cafe in Jakarta. Saving an innocent man’s life is considerably more important than protecting a malicious terrorist from harm and thus governments and societies deem such action acceptable. However, there is a possibility of abuse of power in such scenarios, especially when law enforcement agencies are not subject to close supervision. In the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, thousands of Black Lives Matter supporters marched onto the streets, calling for justice. In some cities such as Milwaukee, the protesters turned violent and assaulted the police, which then justified the police’s retaliation using batons in the name of self-defense. However, allegations of police brutality soon ensued, with critics claiming that certain officers went overboard with their use of force and caused hurt beyond what was necessary, such that death occured, including that of Breonna Taylor in a Louisville demonstration. Other times, officers were non-discriminatory in their bid to control the crowd, even striking at innocent, unarmed and peaceful protesters. That clearly constitutes an abuse of power and breach of trust and is not tolerated by society. Besides self-defense and as a means to an end, violence retains some applications in the enforcement of justice as well. Although society has long since phased out barbaric punishments such as decapitation or burning at the stake, certain violent punishments remain. Capital punishment is one example that advocates of peace regularly criticise, for it is arguably the most violent form of punishment still widely practiced today, involving the state-sanctioned murder of a criminal. It has been abolished by many Western countries, most notably the E.U., but is preserved in the Penal Code of many more countries elsewhere in the world. Its acceptability hinges on what people and governments view as more important – punishment proportional to the crime or belief in human rights, understandably prioritise the latter, while Asian countries, including Singapore, are more conservative and hold that heinous murderers should be executed to deliver justice to their victims. In the sphere of crime and punishment, political norms are key and due to the differences in dominant political philosophies of the East and the West, different forms of punishment are meted out to criminals. However, that is not to say all forms of extant punishment are justifiable on the basis of inherent cultural differences. The use of solitary confinement in the U.S., for example, causing devastating adverse effects on inmates’ mental health by depriving them of social interaction, is generally viewed as unacceptable in Western and Eastern countries alike as it is seen to be tantamount to torture. Hence, not all forms of violent punishment are acceptable, even when controlling for cultural factors. While many promoters of peace evoke figures such as Mahatma Gandhi, who famously said ‘An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind’ to justify that violence is a never-ending cycle and only begets more violence, the truth is the cycle of violence is sometimes inevitable, even in a modernised world where advancements in technology can help us prevent violence before it even arises. Even the U.N. has recognised this, establishing an armed force perhaps ironically called ‘Peacekeepers’ to ensure peace in war-torn regions, even though that peace may very well be fragile. In our collective goal to make the world a safe place, violence is seen as necessary, sanctioned by governments and tolerated by the public in dealing with hostile parties, even though it is generally not practiced due to the immense and often uncontrollable harm it can bring.",To what extent is the use of violence in today’s world acceptable?
Huang Junwei,HCI,2020,37/50,"In 1949, soon after the the Communists’ victory in the Chinese Civil War, the People’s Republic of China was formed. Its leaders intended it to be a ‘classless’ country, for the people, by the people. Although initially meant to ensure a more even distribution of wealth, returning it back to the people from the hands of the corrupt Kuomintang government, the concept of ‘classlessness’ and equality was soon exploited for political purposes, culminating in the Cultural Revolution where millions of scholars and professionals were sent to the countryside to work as labourers to let them experience the lives of ‘an average Chinese citizen’. As a result of dispatching the well-educated to jobs for which they were not suited for, Chinese economic growth stagnated and living standards deteriorated. As the Chinese example shows, egalitarian treatment of all people, while a benevolent goal, should not be taken to the extreme, as equality in its most absolute form, regardless of circumstance, only leads to poorer social outcomes for everyone involved. It is incontrovertible that greater equality is desperately needed in today’s world. Income inequality is very much on the rise, especially in rapidly developing countries such as China and India. The well-educated Chinses and Indians are much better able to fill high-paying jobs in emerging sectors such as tech while the rest languish in jobs from yesterday’s economy, ones that require more menial work, their income growth rate dismal compared to those at the top. As such, it is not uncommon to find anti-elite sentiments, where the bottom 95 percent feel that the top 5 percent are siphoning away all the fruits of their labour, such that even if the economy is booming, they can hardly sense it. This has caused deleterious impacts in terms of social cohesion, resulting in the rise of unscrupulous politicians seeking to tap on this frustration, using rhetoric that only magnifies the divide, most notably ex-U.S. President Donald Trump. Hence, measures to reduce these inequalities ought to be put in place. However, it should definitely be noted that while greater parity in terms of income and wealth is certainly desired, absolute parity is not necessarily desired or desirable. In fact, the evidence is clear that absolute income inequality is harmful for society, both at the individual and macroscopic levels. If absolute income inequality were to be enforced, like in the case of the Soviet Union, people would be equally well-off, regardless of how much work they did, thanks to the egalitarian distribution of resources. This effectively takes away the incentive to work at all, as the same outcome is guaranteed regardless of effort. Increasingly, more and more people will lose their motivation to work, simply because they can leach off the labours of others. On a macroscopic level, the economy will be less productive than before, leading to lower living standards for all. Clearly we should aim to reduce inequality to restore a sense of fairness in income distribution, but not eliminate it altogether, to preserve the motivation to work hard in the hopes of one day becoming rich, ensuring a productive yet more fair economy. Another reason against absolute equality is that instead of blindly distributing resources equally to everyone, they should be distributed according to each person’s needs instead. In American schools, there has been a constant debate on whether affirmative action is appropriate. One of the key arguments against it is that it puts minority students in academically rigorous classes that are beyond their ability, while denying the opportunity to attend these same classes to talented White students. In this case, both parties become worse-off. Minority students feel that they cannot keep up and become discouraged from trying, while White students feel they are wasting their time in classes too easy for them. Equal allocation of resources regardless of individuals’ needs therefore runs the risk of those not needing so much getting much more than they asked for, while those who actually require more of the resource not getting enough. Here, we see that a perfectly egalitarian system does not lead to the best outcome for everyone, and in fact continues to perpetuate the same inequalities that they sought to address. The shift of many societies towards equity must bear this in mind as it recognises that to truly level the playing field, we need to account for everyone’s different starting positions and allocate any additional resources accordingly. Mindlessly promoting people from disadvantaged backgrounds into higher position simply to meet quotas to have a display of racial or gender equality is counter-productive, which is why equality for the sake of equality defeats its purpose for both the organisation and the individual and should not be pursued. But where areas of undue bias and abuse are concerned, equal treatment at all times is a must. It is unacceptable for public figures to be discriminated against simply because of their race, religion or nationality. When Naomi Osaka crashed out in the round of 16 of the Olympics, she received vitriolic abuse online, much of it targeted at her skin colour and ‘how come a Black person could represent Japan’. In comparison, when male (and White) tennis player Novak Djokovic lost just as spectacularly in the quarter-finals, the hateful online speech against him, was in comparison, relatively mild. The disparities in the treatment of Osaka and Djokovic shows hat race, a factor predetermined at birth and beyond our control, can be critical in how we are viewed in society and can take precedence over our actual merits and accomplishments. If these attitudes were to proliferate, it will only send a signal to minorities that their prospects in life are limited by pre-determined factors such as race and religion and that they will be forever marginalised because of that. For fairness and for social harmony, such an outcome is clearly undesirable and must be eradicated. A society that treats the members of its minority the same way as it treats members of the majority is the only one that truly fulfills the principles of equality laid out in many Constitutions, achieved not by subjecting everyone to the same abuse but by eliminating all bigoted abuse. It is striking how certain countries who were founded on the basis of equality and egalitarianism have come full circle, such as China. Initially seeking to promote more equality by allocating everyone the same amount of resources, it eventually abandoned this principle after a period of great political instability in favour of economic growth – the fruits of which were not evenly spread out, creating new geographical and class inequalities that the PRC was originally built to erase. But for the Chinese government, the trade-off has been arguably worth it. Millions have been lifted from poverty as China recorded double-digit economic growth rates in the 1990s and continues to record high single-digit growth rates today. Yet, dissent and unhappiness continues to stir and simmer in light of rising inequalities. It will be interesting to see if China will make the same mistake of pursuing absolute equality again or learn from the mistakes of 60 years ago.",Should everyone be treated equally all the time?
J Wang,N.A.,2021,A,"We may have never been a Galileo of the artistic firmament, but as citizens of a global age, we should be clear-eyed enough to see the true value of art. The term “starving artist” is relevant now more so than ever, used to refer to someone so dedicated to their artistry that economic gains do not matter — after all, they’re not supposed to be in it for the money. Once an artist ceases to starve, we label them a sellout, and we dismiss their work as overvalued. Because of how pragmatic and economically focused the world has become, art is now commodified and its worth is reduced to the price tag it is labelled with at Sotheby’s. Yet Art is worth much, much more, because its true value lies in its capacity for societal change, human connection, and social commentary. The most pragmatic thinkers among us will point out that people pay exactly what they think art is worth, so art must only be worth what people are willing to pay for it. Since art does not nourish our bodies or maintain a roof above our heads, its only worth can be measured in monetary terms — basic economics where demand and supply intersect. Paintings composed of oil, canvas, and silk tend to fetch more than watercolour and crayon. Colour is priced more than its monochromatic counterparts. And because demand for the works of the Renaissance geniuses is high, Michelangelo’s sculptures may even be considered priceless, since the Italian government is unwilling to part with them. Likewise, supply (or lack thereof) determines the prices and hence the (apparent) worth of much art. Supply of films is aplenty, whether at the Cinema, on Netflix, or Hulu. On the other hand, Cirque du Soleil only has so many live performances each year, so it is no wonder that movie tickets are $10 a pop but one must be willing to fork out tens, even hundreds of dollars for a front-row seat at the big red tent. We covet exclusive, limited edition, limited supply forms of art, which we believe defines most of its worth and hence its price tag. So, to the most cynical, who believe every good and service can be estimated in monetary value, Art is only worth the economic value Keynesian framework bestows upon it. However, price tags rarely (if ever) take into account the social value of the artwork. Because such influencers are intangible and wide-ranging, it is almost impossible to quantify, let alone be reflected in their price. Consider Amanda Gorman, the youth poet who bewitched crowds at Biden’s inauguration, then the Super Bowl. Her spoken word poetry was broadcasted live and funnelled into the screens of millions for free, yet the anger and disappointment, and still, hope, evinced a kind of spark in her listeners. This spark is evident as well in Langston’s Mississippi 1995, a tribute to Emmett Till, a reflection of the German Coast uprising. This spark can also be found in the Shattered Glass exhibition in Deitch Gallery, Los Angeles, that featured only artists of colour — the spark that gives a voice to the underrepresented who have been marginalised following decades of slavery, racism, and police brutality. For the Black community, they have long had to perceive their own narrative through a predominantly white lens. Art is a way for them to reclaim autonomy and overturn the history which dictated that blackness must be suffocated by the imperialism of whiteness. For the new generation of filmmakers in South Africa, art in film is another way to widen the aperture on a continent that the rest of the world has dismissed as ravaged by apartheid. The upcoming Netflix film, Blood and Water, is no longer about cliched slums and poverty, but high-powered Black women navigating money, politics, and power in Cape Town. Nollywood (Nigeria’s nod to Hollywood) is still a very new industry worth a fraction of L.A.’s Hollywood, but the gains it will make in terms of redefining a whole country and changing the way people perceive its citizens may be priceless. The overwhelming worth of Art is made all the more evident when we realise that the societies more opposed to the other (the Soviet Union, China under Mao Ze Dong, Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge) produced almost no cultural artefacts worth anything. The change Art evokes varies too greatly between people and communities, but it is undeniable present and cannot be quantified in monetary terms alone. Moreover, Art today is increasingly accessible and affordable such that people pay close to nothing for most art. This is not because art is worthless but because governments — our arbiters of social welfare, our paternal protectors who have our best interests at heart — deem the arts so valuable that they have heavily subsidised it for more citizens to benefit. In Singapore, entry to all museums is free for citizens and permanent residents. Some exhibits cost only $10 per entry. The Louvre is free on Mondays for students. Virtual tours of almost every internationally renowned museum are available online. It would be utterly myopic to claim that entry is free because our cultural institutions, rich with history and knowledge, are worthless. Education in the arts is also heavily subsidised, made possible because governments understand that the humanities cultivate imagination, which is crucial for a prosperous society. Primary school students enjoy virtual drawing, pottery, floral arrangements, cello lessons without having to pay a single cent. And in our daily lives we are exposed to advertisements (it goes without saying that we do not pay for the luxury of viewing ads that make us more educated and conscious citizens — at least, that is the rationale for the Singapore government’s funding of Healthy 365, 10,000 steps a day campaigns. Art takes up 3.5% of our GDP, and most of it is advertising. Hence, even if we pay little for the artistic experience, its worth is valued not monetarily, not even by the number of subsidies and support by the government, but instead its positive externalities and intrinsic worth that is often overlooked. Lastly, the immersion of art is such a universal experience that it does not require payment of any kind (from consumers, governments, stakeholders) for society to enjoy its social commentary. Simply discussing art has an intrinsic worth. “In order to create a new art, one must destroy the ancient art”, wrote the French poet Marcel Schwob more than a hundred years ago. Today, that call to action has been made in the form of a change.org petition demanding that Jeff Bezos — the richest man in the world — buy and eat the Mona Lisa. People have stolen the Mona Lisa, copied the Mona Lisa, even thrown a teacup at the Mona Lisa, but no one has ever eaten the Mona Lisa. While seemingly trivial and childish, the change.org petition garnered tens of thousands of signatures. It reflects the modern-day internetscape of resentment that the wealthiest live in an entirely different world from the working class bourgeoisie; disgust at how frivolously the rich seem to behave; and acute desire to have their demands heard, no matter how ridiculous, through the collective power of the internet. Bezos did not end up buying the Mona Lisa, no money changed hands, and yet we witnessed social commentary. Similarly, a German magician named George Faust lived above 1540 and made claims to fame, including the ability to restore the lost works of Aristotle and Plato, and repeat the miracles of Christ. It was not until poets like Christopher Marlowe took up the legend that he became mythic. The Faustian deal reflects the torment between Good and Evil, a psychological duel characteristic of religion in Renaissance Europe. Marlowe died penniless, having earned hardly anything for his art, but today the ethics of Doctor Faustus are priceless in reminding us of moral limits then and now. Clearly, isn’t it right to say that Art is almost always undervalued monetarily because its intrinsic worth is too abstract and poignant to be comprehended by price-setters? For many of us, art is woven so thoroughly into our lives we have taken it for granted. Our calculated focus on bread and butter issues might cause our distorted worth of art to pale in comparison, but we should think less about monetary worth and more about stepping over the threshold. Once we realise the inestimable worth of art we may only then become, for the first time, citizens of a global age.",Art is only worth what people will pay for it. Do you agree?
Ho,-,2020,A,"Education is often naively thought to be the holy grail of meritocracy. Observers from the outside view the system as a metaphorical social ladder, where all students start at the same point, and their final outcome is a function of only how far they are willing to climb. However, digging below the surface would leave these idealists sorely disillusioned. Underneath the facade of equal competition lies a reality where students are seen not as seeds to grow, but as investments to pump money into so that the rich can secure their status in the upper class. In today’s world, education is a perpetuator of, not a solution to social inequality. In most societies around the world, financial capital from wealthy students’ parents gives them a massive leg-up in the educational rat race. This is because even though politicians who preach the value of education in tackling social inequality point to the equality of opportunity provided to students in school, what truly matters is the enrichment that students receive outside the classroom. In Singapore, for example, there is a bustling tuition industry, as parents scramble to find their children an elusive academic edge. In fact, the Straits Times reported that the average Singaporean parent spends $500 every month on tuition or enrichment classes outside of school. These tuition agencies promise excellent academic results, with some even guaranteeing an ‘A’ or ‘B’ grade for their students – and they deliver. Such after school programs are also commonplace in other pressure cooker education systems such as South Korea. While $500 a month might seem like a worthy investment for more affluent parents, it forms a large proportion of poorer families’ household income, entailing a huge opportunity cost that less well-to-do parents simply cannot afford. From this, it is clear that education perpetuates income inequality, rather than enabling social mobility. Unless the education system is restructured in such a way that financial capital does not give students as much of an advantage, education is not and can never be a solution to social inequality. Other than financial capital, students from higher social classes also advantaged by the cultural capital that many of their peers do not have access to. In a survey by the Institute of Policy Studies, researchers found that while more affluent parents treat education as a top priority for their children, it ranks much lower on the list for parents from lower social classes. This is because for these families, the need to attain a good education conflicts with their more basic needs such as caring for younger children and maintaining their financial stability. In tangible terms, this low priority for education manifests in less enriching or stimulating environments devoid of books and educational games that richer students have access to. Poorer parents’ lower emphasis on education also often translates to their children putting less effort into their school work, making it more difficult for them to do well in school. This insidious source of inequality is nearly omnipresent, deepening the hold of social inequality on poorer families. This situation has become so dire that even America, the country that takes the greatest pride in its meritocracy, has 45% of its Harvard students coming from families earning USD$200,000 a year or more. The fact that students in higher social classes have such a clear advantage in attaining top scores in standardised examinations, proves any claims of education being a solution to social inequality to be nothing more than empty rhetoric. Even when looking beyond the role of individual parents, education can still be said to be a poor solution to social inequality, as there are systemic biases that perpetuate inequality, rather than addressing it. It is true that governments have tried to develop their education systems into true solutions to social inequality. For instance, the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) that American students take at the end of high school takes into account ethnographic factors of students while calculating scores, giving additional points to students that come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Firm believers of education latch onto these examples to propose education as the panacea to social inequality. However, such measures inevitably fall short as they merely target the symptoms of systemic biases; not the root cause. To be a true solution of social inequality, education systems should not base students’ future opportunities on their past performance, as this prevents substantial improvements from being made. For example, students who are able to enter an elite school after their Primary School Leaving Examinations in Singapore have access to opportunities to stretch their mind, while those studying in neighbourhood schools do not. Similarly, in Finland, students posted to vocational schools have many lower-income jobs cut off from them, regardless of how well they perform in class. This is a problem for the education system as early performance is largely hinged on parental support. It is only when students become older that their academic results become more reflective of their own hard work. This means that education currently judges students largely based on parental factors, leaving students little chance to prove themselves as they get older. Considering this, it is clear that the education system exacerbates social inequality rather than solving it. Overall, it might not be wrong to think of education as a ladder. However, we must be aware that the ladder that each student receives can wildly differ. While come students receive sturdy metal ladders that they can easily scale, others receive shoddy ones with shaky legs and broken rungs. Consequently, it is crucial that the government does not simply throw every child ladder, expecting them to eventually ascend to the same place. The ladder’s quality is just far too contingent on parents financial and cultural capital, and too inflicted by systematic biases for this to be effective. For the education system to even endeavour to address social inequality, it has to be majorly reformed to stand alone. School should provide additional assistance to lower-income families, before their children enter primary school to negate richer students’ headstart; more resources should be dedicated to pull-out programmes to reduce the need for tuition; and standardised examinations should be rethought to require more on-the-spot thinking and less drilling. Only then can education truly be a solution to social inequality.",‘Education is a solution to social inequality.’ Do you agree?
Ho Ting H,-,2021,A,"The culture of disposables has gone too far. It began with the small things — a plastic spoon used in place of a metal one; a styrofoam container because you cannot find time to wash your dishes, and a piece of tissue that we carelessly throw away. Then, we moved on to bigger things like carbon emissions and nuclear waste. Now, with the advancement of rocket technology, we are even planning to throw our whole planet away! Unfortunately, this is merely symptomatic of people’s inadequate concern with the green agenda, a term which broadly refers to the political movements promoting environmental protection and sustainable development. Government pays lip-service to the environmental movement to placate the people, but it only countries that are at greater risk of suffering from climate change that are taking concrete action. Firms have put some thought into developing sustainable business practices but this is still subordinate to the pursuit of profits. On the individual level, the hype around disposable containers and metal straws simply exposes a concern with the environment that extends little beyond the superficial and materialistic aspects. Overall, for something that affects the very livelihood of our future generations and that should be the top priority for all, far too little consideration is being given to the green agenda. On the government to level, optimists frequently point to the various environmental agreements that countries have signed as evidence that governments are doing what they can to support the green agenda. A prime example of this is the Paris Climate Agreement, which only a small handful of countries have yet to sign. However, this while this does show that the government is recognising and at least outwardly supporting the green agenda, it is hasty to conclude that this is sufficient to suggest that enough is being done to save the earth from the dire state that it is in today. In 2021, the United Nations Climate Change Council published a report which found that countries must redouble the efforts to even have a slim chance of hitting their targets in the Paris agreement. What this shows is that many governments are merely signing climate agreements for political capital and soft power, and that they are paying such insufficient attention to becoming green to the extent of not even being able to meet the targets that they had set for themselves. If one scrutinises the environmental initiatives carried out by governments of different countries, one would quickly realise that only countries that stand to benefit from taking the green agenda into account are doing so. The overall heavy focus on self-interest in saving the Earth in itself reveals an insufficient consideration of the true meaning behind the green agenda, which is that every single person has a duty to care for mother Earth, not just for oneself, but for the collective good. Singapore is one country that has sufficiently considered the green agenda in its city planning. For example, in 2021, the city completed construction of the worlds largest floating solar power plant along the Strait of Johor, effectively offsetting the carbon emissions of nearly 1000 cars. On top of that, the country also kickstarted its cooling Singapore 2.0 project in 2021, to research how it can become a greener, more liveable city. In contrast, many other countries have simply brushed green agenda aside in the pursuit of other goals. For instance, the United States refused to sign the Basel convention regulating the use of disposable plastics, after the America chemical council spent $14 million lobbying against it. The reason behind this disparity is clear – as a low-lying, highly urbanised city-state, Singapore stands to gain massively from mitigating the effects of climate change, so that residents’ standard of living can be maintained. In contrast, as a large, highly developed country, the United States is less adversely affected by global warming, and has hence prioritised its political and economic objectives over the green agenda. Selective consideration of the green agenda on the global scale reveals that insufficient attention is being paid to the true intentions of the movement. This is because without every single country, especially developed ones like America, selflessly committed to protecting the Earth we live in, it is unlikely that environmental initiatives will ever gain enough traction to make a substantial impact, before it is too late. A similar problem lies in the way that the green agenda is considered by firms. While firms take the green agenda into account when developing their business practices, it is often inadequate, as it ultimately remains subordinate to the profit incentive. In Indonesia, peat fires resulting from slash-and-burn tactics have been a long-standing issue despite regulation by the government. After a suffocating haze was released from its plantations in 2015, paper company Sinar Mas committed to increasing the sustainability of its plantations by refraining from using fire to economically clear land. However, it is clear that the efforts were half-hearted. In 2019, there was yet another bout of forest fires in Indonesia, which released more carbon dioxide than the fires in the Amazon. After an investigation by the authorities, it was found that while Sinar Mas did not set any fires intentionally this time round, the company also failed to take sufficient measures to prevent its highly flammable peatland from catching fire, as it was expensive to do so. What this example shows is that though firms are considering the sustainability aspect of their operations, it is often superficial and insufficient, as it does not go beyond abiding by the letter of the law, to ensuring that they are doing the best they can to protect the planet. If this continues, it is unlikely that governments will be able to meet nationwide climate goals without substantial resistance from profit-motivated firms. Hence, firms are doing the bare minimum for the green agenda, which is insufficient, considering how environmental protection is a collective effort, and one of the most pressing concerns of our day. Lastly, on the individual level, consideration of the green agenda remains materialistic and superficial, which is grossly inadequate in a time when concrete steps are needed to protect the earth. In recent years, reusable cutlery has been all the hype, with many companies producing forks and spoons made of metal and bamboo. Considering the high take-up rate in some countries such as 60% in Hong Kong, it appears that the youth are considering the green agenda in their lifestyle, and taking steps to lead a more sustainable life. However, individuals are still not taking sufficient responsibility to ensure sustainability beyond the physical items that they purchase. For example, a survey conducted in Singapore by MediaCorp in 2020, found that the vast majority of Singaporeans thought the government should be the main stakeholder doing more to push the green agenda. While it is true that the government has the power to make the largest impact in fostering sustainability, doing the bare minimum on the individual level and expecting the government to fill in the gaps would not cut it either. After all, the success of guidelines released by the government is still subject to the acceptance and reception of residents. To sufficiently consider the green agenda in their day-to-day life, people need to do what a small minority of youth throughout the world has done – speak up about their concerns, refuse to patronise unsustainable firms, and campaign for change. Taking into account the importance of individuals in pushing the green agenda, it is only by doing so that concrete changes will take place. Small changes like switching to reusable cutlery are a good start, but individuals need to go beyond that to have truly integrated the green agenda into their lives. Overall, it ironically seems that as environmental concerns become larger in scale, as it moves beyond physical items, beyond profits, and beyond the individual country, they are less and less well-considered. Stakeholders need to re-evaluate the extent to which the green agenda plays a role in influencing the actions, and whether this is sufficient. If we continue considering the sustainability movement half-heartedly, it would at our own peril.",Assess the view that not enough consideration is given to the green agenda.
Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,A,"Since the Industrial revolution, the use of technology such as machines and smart phones has been on the rise. As technological companies constantly renovate in the pursuit of manufacturing more competent and modern technology to improve the world’s standards of living, life has definitely been made better through the use of modern technology. However, loopholes in technological systems can also be manipulated to obtain crucial information, wreaking havoc and chaos in countries.  Technology makes life better as it facilitates communication through devices such as smart phones and laptops for both individuals and business companies. This can improve individual lives, as there is increased ease of communication, allowing individuals to communicate conveniently within a short span of time. It can also allow for globalisation an expansion of economy as it allows different stakeholders from all around the world to communicate with ease to ensure smooth running of operations and businesses globally. For example, the Internet has allowed for social media communication platforms such as Skype or email for businesses to communicate via face to face or voice calls.  Technology also allows for quick and easy manufacturing of material goods, increasing productivity rates in the workforce and stimulating economic growth. This has, in turn, caused lowering of market prices of consumer goods, benefitting individuals and making their lives better. For example, ever since the combine harvester was manufactured, crops were harvested at greater speeds with greater efficiency, as there was a reduction in the need for human labour. This made life easier for individuals working in the field of agriculture and also stimulated economic growth of the country due to increased productivity rates.  Though some may swear to the notion that technology makes life more difficult as there are several risks involved, I beg to differ. Technology may seem to bring many risks as loopholes in technology may be manipulated in ways such as hacking of computer software to obtain crucial information to wreak widespread havoc in individual countries. For example, a few hackers with malicious intent hacked into the American defence system, posing a threat to the country’s security. However, with proper deterrence measures to ensure the security of online sites, the risks associated with the use of technology can be eliminated. For example, in Singapore, Interpol worked with the government to tighten security of crucial online systems as a deterrence and safety measure against hackers. Hence, though the use of technology can be risky and may cause internal complications, such risks can be avoided through stringent security measures.  In conclusion, technology can make life better if measures are adopted to eliminate and reduce the risks it brings. Government should improve safety measures by enhancing the security of crucial online websites and also enforcing the rules by meting out severe punishments to offenders to deter such crimes.",Does technology always make life better?
Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,A,"In the 21st century, increasingly declining birth rates have given rise to an ageing population or ‘silver tsunami’, where two in five will be above the age of 65 by 2050 in Singapore. This exacerbates the problem of a declining tax base, yet an increasing population of elderly to support. Though some may swear to the notion that the elderly are nothing but hindrances to the progress of the Singaporean society, I beg to differ. Not only do the elderly offer a wealth of advice to the younger generation, they also play a fundamental role in strengthening social fabric in today’s society. The elderly are valuable assets in society as they have a wealth of advice and wisdom to offer to the younger generation as they gradually take over the running of the country,. As the elderly have gone through many experiences, they would have acquired the wisdom to offer valuable advice to the younger generation to allow the next generation of leaders to learn from the successes and failures of the older generation. For example, although former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had already stepped down from his position of Prime Minister, he still continued to offer valuable advice to ensure smooth running of the country by the subsequent prime minister. This helped Singapore to progress to the thriving metropolis it is today.  The elderly play an irreplaceable role in families today, hence strengthening our social fabric. The elderly play a vital role in drawing families together and strengthening family ties as they pass down family traditions from one generation to another. This maintains the culture and tradition of each family, hence causing the family to be more closely knitted. For example, the Chinese tradition of having reunion dinner on the eve of Chinese new year has been passed down from generation to generation, strengthening bonds in the family. Hence, the elderly play a major role in strengthening social fabric in today’s society.  However, some may argue to say that the elderly are nothing but hindrances as they exhaust limited tax revenue of the country, posing a hindrance to economic growth and progress of the country. As the elderly are often retired and have stopped working, they do not contribute to the country’s tax revenue in any way. Hence, this often results in tax revenue from the middle-aged population having to support larger population including the young and old. Because of this, the elderly are regarded as burdens as they use up economic resources and stifle economic growth of the country. Furthermore, due to bodily wear and tear, the elderly are more susceptible to illnesses and tend to fall sick more often, exhausting medical resources and government medical subsidies. For example, the elderly are twice as susceptible to degenerative diseases such as heart disease and osteoporosis as compared to the young, increasing the likelihood of them reading and using up limited medical resources.  In conclusion, the elderly are not mere hindrances in society as although they do not contribute significantly in the economic perspective, they contribute in other ways by playing a vital role in advising the younger generation and strengthening social fabric. To ease the economic burden posed by the elderly, more insurance schemes should be set up to cover the he expenses incurred by the elderly, hence relieving the economic burden on the younger generation.",Do you agree that it is inevitable for the elderly to be a burden to society?
Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,A,"In our fast paced society, modern technology is often placed on a pedestal, with the latest science and technology regarded as sure-fire ways to resolve many of our problems today. Modern technology has led to the exploration of many frontiers, such as genetic engineering, cloning, abortion and more. While some may swear to the notion that modern technology is always a blessing as it gives rise to many new possibilities, I beg to differ. Modern technology has brought about a multitude of problems, owing to its transient and controversial nature. Furthermore, exploitation of technology can also give rise to many repercussions.  The transient nature of modern technology renders it quickly outdated in our rapidly evolving world and thus quickly becomes irrelevant and useless in the modern day. Since the discovery of penicillin, antibiotics were hailed as the ‘miracle cure’ to panoply of bacterial infections, with people becoming heavily dependent on it to fight bacterial infections of all sorts. However, the quick evolution of bacteria, coupled with the decreasing pace of new antibiotic discovery, have given rise to a deadly problem – antibiotic resistance. As bacteria constantly evolve and mutate, they develop resistance to antibiotics, causing the drugs to have no effect on them. Furthermore, heavy reliance on antibiotics has resulted in humans being defenceless to these infections. This phenomenon has resulted in the deaths of many, including Mdm Siti Hajar, who was robbed of her eyesight and left with multiple organ failures following infection by resistant bacteria, on which antibiotics had no effect on. As such, the growing rate of evolution has quickly rendered many older developments in technology outdated and useless. This, coupled with strong reliance on modern technology has resulted in disastrous outcomes when such technology no longer works. Indeed, as George Bernard Shaw once aptly quipped, “Science does not solve a problem without creating ten more.” Science and modern technology have not only failed to be a blessing, but also led to newer and more serious problems.  Furthermore, modern technology has led to many ethical concerns that result in a division of opinions and controversy. As Albert Einstein once famously said, “It has become appallingly apparent that our technology has exceeded our humanity.” Scientific development rarely occurs without leaving a trail of shattered morals and blatant dishonesty behind. The legalisation of abortion as late as six weeks into pregnancy have led to the division of those for ‘pro-life’ and ‘pro-choice’, with the ‘pro-life’ claiming that the procedure of injecting poison into a foetus’s skull is inhumane. Since the absence of a heartbeat is used to signal death, shouldn’t the presence of a heartbeat be used to signal life as well? The unborn foetus, though not fully developed should thus be seen as a life. Abortion is thus akin to murder. On the other hand, those for ‘pro-choice’ believe that the mother should be given the rights to decide whether to deliver the baby or not. This has led to a division of opinions, causing great controversy. Moreover, the recent discovery of the infinite possibilities of stem cell research have led to many countries jumping on the bandwagon and pumping in millions of dollars to explore this new frontier. However, this again sparked controversy, with people claiming that pluripotent embryonic stem cells, having the potential to create a life, should not be used at our disposal as life is seem to be sacred. As such, modern technology has resulted in much division, sometimes even resulting in polarisation of society and can sometimes be seen as a curse rather than a blessing.  Exploitation of modern technology by the ruthless has resulted in many disastrous and irreversible outcomes. Modern technology such as the genetic engineering of rice crops to increase crop yield of its offspring was once seen as a blessing as it solved the problem of famine in India. However such genetically engineered crops took on a more insidious nature as companies like Monsanto cunningly engineered the seeds to be infertile and priced them at inordinate sums, forcing farmers to have to purchase a new batch of seeds at the end of each season. These farmers clung on to the promise of tremendous profit, as they were made to believe by companies like Monsanto, yet continued to find themselves increasingly mired in debt. Many of them committed suicide out of desperation, leading to an increase in farmer suicides in India. The greed of humans have led to manipulations in the original pure intentions behind modern technology and brought about many disastrous outcomes. The discovery of nuclear power by Albert Einstein, initially meant for the betterment of society as a more sustainable way of generating electricity have also resulted in tragic outcomes during world war two in the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing millions of innocent civilians. Upon witnessing the destruction unleashed upon the country, the pilots of the Enola Gay said, “My God, what have we done?” a sentiment that many will say characterises the use of technology today. Even today, countries like North Korea, which has failed to disarm, frequently launch test missiles, terrorising surrounding countries like Japan and South Korea. The good intentions behind such inventions were adulterated by wicked humans and have thus brought about suffering instead of the blessings it was originally meant to bring.  However, major progressions brought about by modern technology have resulted in some claims that modern technology always brings about blessings. In modern society, science has made quantum leaps and opened doors of possibilities that were previously absent. Modern technology has allowed for tremendous progress to be made in the day-to-day living of people and have definitely fulfilled its original purpose to be a blessing to others.  Though it is safe to say that modern technology has its fair share of successes, it is inaccurate to state that outcomes from modern technology is always a blessing. As scientists push boundaries like never before and start to explore foreign domains, there are bound to be experimental error that modern technology brings about. After all, the continuous development of modern technology is on the basis of the ‘scientific inquiry’ and experimental errors are inevitable in the exploration of technology. Thalidomide, which was a sleeping pill taken to alleviate morning sickness was said to be so mild that even pregnant woman could take it without side effects. However, this costly mistake resulted in the birth of thousands of newborns with deformed limbs. Such errors in the field of technology, though inevitable, have brought about terrible outcomes.  Although modern technology is lauded to be the most reliable and effective panacea to our global problems, it is vital that we reduce our dependency on such developments and learn to be wary of them. It is unlikely that modern technology will turn out to be a utopian fantasy, but let us not let it head in the direction of a Faustian nightmare.",Is modern science and technology always a blessing?
Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,A,"In the 2018 world economic forum, environmental activist Greta Thunberg instantly shot to fame after having famously made the comment that “the world is on fire”. Indeed, discouraging statistics obtained by scientists showing the rapidly deteriorating state of our world, coupled with the lack of necessary government policies have led many to despondently conclude that saving the environment is a futile pursuit. However, I stand by the view that given increasing awareness of the issue by empowered individuals like Greta Thunberg as well as the increasing potential of green technology, environmental protection can be a fruitful and not a futile one.  Detractors who argue that environmental conservation is a futile pursuit put forth the argument that it is simply too late to reverse climate change. With carbon dioxide levels reaching an unprecedented 393ppm, which is a far cry from the recommended safety threshold of 350ppm by scientists in the UN, scientists have likened it to a hurtling freight train that would end in tragedy even if stopped immediately. Indeed, even if humans were to cease all emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, ominous phenomena such as global warming rising sea temperatures and the melting of ice caps would still continue. Such critics will no doubt agree with John Keynes famous remark, “The long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run, we are all dead.” Many contend that the adoption of a conservationist approach, where individuals use natural resources to the fullest extent, is the better option. Since climate change is inevitable, this leads many to despondently conclude that saving the environment is a futile pursuit.  However, such critics have overlooked the vast potential of technology to not only reduce, but also reverse the damage already inflicted on our planet, rendering environmental conservation a fruitful pursuit. Much technological and scientific progress has been made, and many technical solutions have been devised to combat climate change. Such technology can help reduce to emissions as well as its impact on the environment. For example, carbon captures technology, which reduces carbon dioxide emissions by capturing it and storing it underground. New materials have also been invented to be used in buildings and aircrafts, reducing the amount of carbon dioxide generated. Not only can technology reduce environmental damage, it can also reverse environmental damage through means like solar geoengineering, which releases particles into the atmosphere that reflects sunlight, cooling the planet. While many of these ideas are in its incipient stages, they certainly provide hope for us that climate change can be solved. Technology has already done a lot to solve it, through inventions like electric cars, solar panels and nuclear energy. Such technology has opened doors of infinite possibilities, and it is myopic to say that it is too late to stop climate change and that it is a futile attempt.  Detractors have also overlooked the potential of empowered individuals to bring environmental issues to the fore and pressure governments to act. Whether in a democracy or autocracy, public sentiment is key, as leaders need it to maintain legitimacy and keep power. If the people demand environmental conservation, the threat of the ballot box means they must deliver — or risk getting voted out of power. The trend of youths becoming increasingly aware and vocal about the issue only means governments is even more pressured to act. For example, youth activist Greta Thunberg, who skipped school every Friday to raise awareness about environmental conservation, became an icon for thousands of youth in Europe who started doing the same. More importantly, this led to “Greta Thunberg effect” where more environmentally conscious political parties saw huge gains in the recent 2019 Europe parliament elections. Clearly, environmental conservation need not be a futile pursuit, given the vast power wielded by each and every individual to incite political change.  Given increasing global consensus on the urgency of the issue and increasing number of global measures to combat climate change, environmental conservation is definitely not a futile pursuit. The defining characteristic of climate change is the sheer scale of the issue – everyone contributes to it and everyone is affected by it. Such a large-scale issue thus requires any climate action undertaken to be on a global scale for it to be effective. Any climate action undertaken by Singapore, for example, would be useless if India, US and china continue belching out greenhouse gases. In light of this, it is encouraging that there are plans and actions undertaken on a global level to combat climate change. The 2015 Paris climate agreement gathered almost 200 countries to agree to keep temperature rise “well below” 2 degrees from pre-industrial times. Countries even set specific targets to be accomplished by 2020 in order to tackle the issue of climate change. This was followed by the COP24 conference in Copenhagen in 2018 where countries met up to set specific targets and action plans to fulfil the targets set in the Paris climate agreement. Given that tangible results have already seen such as China placing a cap on coal consumption, it would be foolhardy to conclude that environmental conservation is a futile pursuit. Though some may be sceptical about eventual success of such an agreement, it is certainly a step in the right direction. Not only does such an agreement bind countries to honour their targets, it also takes other crucial steps such as having richer countries provide financial and technological aid to poorer countries for them to industrialise in a clean and green way. Such multilateral policies that unite nations towards the common cause of environmental conservation are key to addressing the issue of climate change effectively. Given the increasing presence of such policies it is definitely possible for environmental conservation to be a fruitful pursuit instead of a futile one.  It is ultimately up to humankind not to lie supine in the face of the environmental doom that awaits our planet. Whether or not environmental conservation is a futile pursuit depends very much on the people. Given the increasing call for climate action, environmental protection may very well be a fruitful pursuit as people work together and pressure politicians to tackle this issue. Conversely, if we do not take action now, and douse the flames that are consuming our home, this house will continue to burn until we perish along with it.",‘Protecting the environment is a futile pursuit.’ How far do you agree?
Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,A,"People are inherently curious, and will always seek to understand that which surrounds them, through means such as science or religion. Religion, defined as the unwavering faith and believe in a higher being, explains many of life’s mysteries such as the reason behind our fragile existence through subscription to God’s word. Science, on the other hand, explains a multitude of conundrums through vigorous experimentation and observation in order to obtain solid proof to explain natural phenomena. Though the two approaches may seem to have divergent natures, they are in fact not mutually exclusive and can coexist in harmony without one rendering the other obsolete.  Critics may argue to say that Science and religion are ultimately divergent in nature. Given the many conflicts that have occurred between the two approaches in the past, coupled with recent Scientific development, religion has definitely been rendered increasingly obsolete. Science is the use of empirical evidence and vigorous experimentation to establish beyond a doubt that a given hypothesis is true. Through the use of the Scientific inquiry, which is based on the fundamental cornerstone of curiosity, vigorous crosschecking occurs between various scientists to ascertain the validity of the hypothesis before it is established as a fact. Religion, on the other hand, employs the use of God’s word, instead of logic and empirical evidence, to ascertain a certain belief. It does not require solid proof to establish a belief, its cornerstone being that of faith, which is the unwavering belief in a higher being. Evidently, the two are divergent in nature and cannot be used at the same time to explain a single phenomenon. Examples of this include Darwinism in defiance of creationism and heliocentrism as opposed to geocentrism. Given current rapid scientific development, which has resulted in more people employing scientific methods to explain phenomena, it would seem that lesser people would subscribe to God’s word, rendering it obsolete.  However, detractors have overlooked the fact that though it is indeed true that religion and science are divergent approaches, they are in fact not mutually exclusive. This can be seen in many cases where scientific beliefs have been reconciled with scripture. Buddhism has actively encouraged the exploration of the world through empiricism, which is similar to that employed by the scientific inquiry. As Abdul-baha, who is the founder of the Baha’I faith aptly quipped, “religion without science is superstition and science without religion is materialism. Indeed, it is clear that it is possible for science to be integrated into religion and the two are not mutually exclusive. Recently, liberal Catholics have even managed to reconcile scriptures with Darwin’s theory of evolution. Evidently, Science and religion, though divergent in nature and approach, are not mutually exclusive and can be employed together. Furthermore, Science and religion serve different domains, and when each remains in its own domain, the two can exist in harmony without posing conflict. Science provides an explanation for various natural phenomena in the physical world whereas religion tends to provide explanations to a myriad of conundrums to which Science cannot provide any answer. While science can explain how various systems in our body are interrelated in function that allow us to be a fully functional being, it cannot explain the purpose behind our existence. Science can explain the causes behind mental illnesses like depression and invent chemicals like dopamine to raise levels of happiness, but it is unable to teach us how to find our inner peace. Indeed, doctor Jennifer Wiseman was astute in her observation that while science is wonderful tool for understanding the physical universe, religion gives the answers to the more philosophical questions in life and explains our significance in the context of the universe. Both science and religion ultimately serve to better our human experience and lives and when each remains in their domain, they can coexist in harmony.  Science and religion can also serve to reinforce each other and are thus able to coexist without rendering either of them obsolete. Indeed, many scientists such as Richard Smalley have expressed the view that science serves to further reinforce religion, as they are better able to appreciate God’s handiwork after understanding the myriad of wonders of the physical world through science. Furthermore, religion serves as a much necessary check and balance on science and prevents ethically questionable scientific research from occurring, reinforcing it. Through the many values propagated by religions like Christianity such as the sanctity of life and nature, boundaries are drawn in fields like genetic engineering and cloning, preventing ethically suspect research from occurring that may result in the value and dignity of life being contravened. It is no wonder that the tide of pubic opinion has been turned against genetic engineering in many countries such as Britain, where genetically modified products have to be clearly labelled and genetically modified foodstuff face an outright ban. Indeed, religion and science are able to reinforce each other and the existence of each domain only strengthens the other. In this respect, neither is rendered obsolete.  Science and religion, though divergent approaches, are not mutually exclusive. As Doctor Andrew Harman once said, “Science is about learning, Buddhism is about living.” Ultimately, science and religion are just tools to enhance the human experience and it is up to us to wield them appropriately to improve our lives instead of cause conflict.","‘In this era of rapid Scientific development, religion is becoming obsolete.’ How far do you agree?"
Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,A,"As the world is rapidly evolving, Science and technology have been increasingly lauded as the most effective panacea to our daily problems, ranging from the most minute of problems such as a minor cold, to more global issues such as famine. While some may swear to the notion that Science and technology is foolproof in solving global problems due to its past successes, I beg to differ. Science has shown itself to be unreliable, as not only is it unable to solve certain pressing global issues, it also brings a host of other issues along with it.  Proponents of the claim that scientific and technological developments are solutions to global problems argue that the reliability of such developments make it successful as a panacea to global issues. Due to the fact that there are many scientists involved in a single scientific inquiry, the experimental data obtained is likely to be reliable due to the large network of scientists available to cross-check the findings and data gathered. The reliability and thus, success of science in solving global problems can be seen through the myriad of drugs developed to cure daily ailments such as a simply cough or cold. The success of science can also be seen by how diseases such as smallpox, which used to be a highly feared, deadly disease, has now been fully eliminated in the human race through successful scientific developments like vaccinations. Because of its reliability and previous successes, science is lauded as an effective solution to our problems.  However, critics may argue that science and technology is not effective as a solution to our global problems as it carries a host of other problems with it, which offsets the aforementioned successes it brought about. As George Bernard Shaw once aptly quipped, “Science does not solve a problem without creating ten more.” Science rarely solves a problem without leaving a trail of blatant dishonesty and shattered morals behind. The problem of a lack of efficient and renewable electrical sources birthed the discovery of nuclear power, using Albert Einstein’s Physics equation. However, nuclear power took on a more insidious nature after the Manhattan project where the first atomic bomb was formulated to stop world war in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing millions of innocent civilians in the process. Upon witnessing the damage wreaked, the pilots of the Enola Gay said, “My God, what have we done?” a sentiment that many will say characterises the use of scientific discovery today. The effects of the use of the atomic bomb was so devastating that even Albert Einstein declared himself an ardent anti-nuclear activist and said that he would have never formulated his equation had he known the use it would be put to. Another example of the use of technology is genetically modified crops, initially designed to solve the problem of famines in developing countries. However, it led to increased resistance amongst pests and even upset the ecosystem, failing to resolve the issue of famine. Hence, science is limited in its ability to provide solutions to global problems as it often leads to the creation of a host of other problems, often worsening the initial situation.  Science is also limited in its ability to solve global problems due to ethical issues, often owing to the selfish, greedy nature of humans. Scientists are ultimately still human, and are motivated by goals such as profit maximisation, sometimes even at all costs. Scientists attempt to solve global hunger issues in developing countries through the invention of genetically modified crops, such as golden rice, eventually backfired due to humans’ inherent greediness and self-centred nature. To satisfy aims of profit maximisation, many companies modified crops such that they were infertile and attached patent rights to them, hence causing poor farmers to have to purchase a new bath of seeds at the end of each season at exorbitant prices. This, coupled with companies promises to farmers of huge profit making opportunities left many farmers in huge debt as they forked over inordinate sums for the genetically modified produce but never reaped the expected profit. In desperation, some of them committed suicide, leading to an increase in farmer suicides in countries like India. Furthermore, in the pursuit of the fame and fortune associated with discovering the next blockbuster drug, many unethical scientists modify their research findings to suit their hypotheses. Korean Scientist Hwang Woo Suk was granted several millions of dollars in order to conduct his supposed stem cell research, only to realise that his results were based on fabricated experiments. As Albert Einstein once aptly quipped, “It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.” Technology is limited in solving problems due to unethical practices by humans to satiate their hunger for fame and monetary gain often causing initially effective solutions to backfire.  The transient nature of scientific developments, coupled with our rapidly evolving world has quickly rendered many scientific discoveries outdated, posing limitations in solving many global problems. For example, the discovery of penicillin birthed a race between fast-evolving bacteria and creation of newer, stronger antibiotics by scientists. As bacteria are constantly evolving through natural selection and ‘survival of the fittest’, there has been an increasing need for stronger antibiotics to combat resistant bacteria. Any slow-down in the discovery of antibiotics could lead to disastrous outcomes as this could mean that there are no drugs available to cure a certain disease — rendering the disease incurable. Singapore has seen several cases of blindness in patients due to the inabilility of antibiotics to fight against resistant bacteria, as the bacteria have evolved to become so resistant that no antibiotics available are able to cure the disease, resulting in worsening infections of the eye. Thus, due to the transient nature of scientific discovery that quickly renders ‘older discoveries’ outdated and ineffective, it is limited in its ability to solve global problems, as it is only a matter of time before evolution overtakes scientific discovery.  In conclusion, Science and technology are limited in its ability to solve global problems. More often than not, it creates a new set of problems, rather than solving old ones. It is imperative that society stops putting so much faith in scientific discovery and start to become more wary of the detrimental effects it can bring. Though scientific discovery is unlikely to result in a utopian fantasy, we have to ensure that it does not head in the direction of becoming a Faustian nightmare.",Consider the effectiveness of Science and technology in resolving world problems today.
Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,A,"Since the scientific revolution, Science has made quantum leaps, with Scientists exploring new frontiers and pushing boundaries like never before. Huge advancements in scientific discovery have opened up many possibilities, such as that of biotechnology, genetic engineering, cloning and many more. However, what is truly the main role of scientists in the modern world? While some may argue that the main role of scientists is to seek truth, I beg to differ. Though it is true that science was originally pursued as an intellectual study to find out more about our world and seek truth, the temptation of our modern world today such as that of fame and monetary gain have adulterated what started off as pure and innocent intentions of scientists to seek truth.  Proponents of the view that scientists today seek to find truth argue that science is the study of the world around us and the cornerstone of scientific discovery is ultimately curiosity. In this respect, the main role of scientists should be to seek truth regarding our world. For example, several scientists today have pumped in millions of dollars simply to find out more about how the earth came to be and how humans came into existence. Another classic example is Albert Einstein, who made groundbreaking discoveries in the world of Physics while working as a clerk at a Swiss office, all on the basis of curiosity. These examples show that the main motivating factor of scientists is curiosity about our world and thus, the pursuit of truth. Even the nature of the scientific inquiry boils down to the fundamental trait of curiosity. As such, the main role of scientists today is to discover the truth.  However, while the initial intentions of scientists may have been to seek truth, the temptations of the modern world, such as money and profits have caused many scientists to diverge from their original aim of seeking truth to that of profit maximisation. For instance, companies that manufacture genetically modified crops such as Monsanto have engineered their crops to be infertile and also attached patent rights to them, causing them to be sold at exorbitant prices to make more profit. This forced poor subsistent farmers in India to buy a new batch of seeds at the end of every season, causing many of them to be mired in huge debt. Eventually, many of them committed suicide in desperation, contributing to the high number of farmer suicides in India. Another example is thalidomide, which is a sleeping pill manufactured by Scientists which was assumed to be so mild even pregnant women could take the pill and would result in no side effects. Scientists were so eager to market their findings and profit from it that the drug was not properly tested before it was marketed causing thousands of babies to be born with deformed limbs. As such profit maximisation has become a priority that has began to override the pursuit of truth for many scientists, who would do anything just to earn an extra cent. As Albert Einstein once aptly quipped, “It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.” The syphilis experiment conducted in Alabama where blacks were unknowingly injected with syphilis virus to investigate its effects on the human body for scientists to save cost on obtaining willing test subjects also shows the extent the scientists would go just to maximise their profits. Indeed, motives of scientists have taken on a much more insidious nature and has definitely gone beyond that of seeking truth.  In modern society, many scientists have also prioritised fame over seeking truth. In today’s context, were science is often placed on a pedestal and lauded as the most effective solution to our problems, much recognition and awards are given to scientists who make significant findings in their field. A classic example would be that of the Nobel prizes, founded by Alfred Nobel. The fame associated with discovering the next blockbuster drug is huge, so much so that scientists would pursue that recognition at all costs. Korean scientist Hwang Woo Suk, who fabricated experimental results to obtain recognition and fame through the supposed stem cell research he was conducting, is a good example to illustrate that scientists roles have switched away from seeking truth to their own selfish pursuits of fame. Scientists have even neglected the truth and fabricated experimental results to obtain their much-desired recognition.  Furthermore, the panoply of problems present in society today such as our burgeoning world population, exacerbating the issue of world hunger have led many scientists to focus on the noble cause of resolving world problems and conflict, instead of merely seeking truth for the sake of it. The example of genetically modified crops can also be used to illustrate this, where many scientists invented genetically modified crops such as frost resistant tomatoes and pest resistant lettuce to resolve the issue of world hunger especially in developing countries. This resulted in many farmers in countries in Africa having more sustainable crop produce, reducing the problem of food shortages. The problem of malnutrition amongst African children was also reduced by discoveries such as golden rice which is rich in vitamin A. another illustration is Physician Edward Jenner who discovered the vaccine for smallpox but refused to attach patent rights to it as that would prevent the poor from obtaining access to the vaccine. Such scientists have gone beyond the pursuit of cold, hard truths to devoting their discoveries to advancing and improving the lives of the human race. Thus the role of scientists today has stretched beyond that of seeking truth to resolving pressing world problems.  In conclusion, the role of scientists in the modern world has stretched far beyond that of seeking truth. Intentions of scientists have evolved over time, changing for both the better and the worse. More precaution should be exercised and individuals should be more wary of the myriad of scientific discoveries today. Scientific discoveries may have yet to show itself to lead to the formation of a utopian fantasy, but let us not let it head in the direction of a Faustian nightmare.",‘Our job as Scientists is to find the truth.’ How far do you agree that this view accurately reflects the role of Scientists today?
Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,A,"As Albert Einstein once aptly quipped, “It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.” Indeed, Science, once founded on the basis of the noble pursuit of truth to benefit mankind, has become increasingly adulterated by the profit-driven motives of research giants all around the world. While some may swear to the notion that it is impossible for Science to exist apart from business, I stand by the view that the commercialisation of Science has destroyed the original intentions behind its development and also led to a host of undesirable ethical issues. For this reason, I believe that as far as possible, Science should not coexist with business.  The coexistence of Science and business has led to the destruction of the original noble intentions behind it, which is to benefit those who need it, the most – the poor. However, the profit-driven nature of businesses has caused the latest drugs and technology to be attached to hefty price tags making them impossible for the poor to attain. Genetically modified crops, including pest resistant and vitamin rich produce such as golden rice have been lauded as the most effected panacea to world hunger. However, profit-driven companies such as Monsanto have attached patents to the crops and engineered them to be infertile such that farmers will have to purchase new seeds at the end of each season. This, coupled with the exorbitant prices such crops were marketed at, caused many farmers in India to be mired in huge debt, causing a high number of farmer suicides in India. Another salient example is the sale of antiretroviral drugs for inordinate sums of money, at up to USD900 per month. Given the rapid proliferation of HIV/AIDS in developing countries such as sub-Saharan Africa, this resulted in most being unable to afford the drugs and thus having to go without treatment. Not only does the coexistence of Science and business lead to failure to benefit those in dire need of it, it also results in widening of the rich-poor divide, resulting in polarisation of society. While the rich are able to access treatment to illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, the poor are left to suffer without the aid of such drugs, simply because they are not as well to do. As such, Science should not coexist with business because it fails to achieve its original intentions – to benefit those in most dire need of it. The association of science with business have also resulted in a myriad of ethical issues, some of which contravene the very value and dignity of life. In a bid to maximise profits and reduce costs, there have been instances where test objects were coerced and forced to undergo cruel human testing. As human testing is seen as a better research method to obtain more accurate results, there have been instances where scientists have conducted such tests to obtain better test results and hopefully be able to generate more profit in the process. The syphilis experiment in Alabama saw blacks being unknowingly injected with syphilis virus in order for scientists to observe its effects on the human body. Another example is Dr Josef Mengele, the “Angel of Death” who conjoined twins and injected dye into prisoner’s eyes during the war. Though the latter example may have elements of vengeance in it, profit- driven motivations may have also played a part in it. As such, science should not coexist with business lest it results in such unethical behaviour. Furthermore, the commercialisation of science may also result in instances of academic dishonesty. In a bid to acquire the wealth and fame associated with discovering the next blockbuster drug, this may lead scientists to fabricate their scientific experiments and results. Korean scientist and researcher Hwang Woo Suk was granted millions of dollars to conduct stem cell research, only to realise that results were fabricated. Therefore, science should not coexist with business as it encourages and provides an incentive for dishonesty in scientists. However, proponents of the notion that science cannot coexist without business may argue to say that without the objective of profit maximisation, scientists would not be incentivised to continue researching about ways to improve the lives of mankind. After all, money makes the world go round. Furthermore, the commercialisation of science has provided an incentive for scientists to address the most pressing needs of society quickly. In a bid to line their pockets, scientists compete with each other to produce the most effective, cheapest cure to meet the most urgent needs of society. Such competition expedites the pace of research. Hence, the association of science and business has benefitted society by quickly addressing their most pressing needs. However, though the marketing of science has indeed allowed the addressing of society’s most urgent needs, this has resulted in failure to address areas that are not as promising from the monetary perspective, but nevertheless, as important. The pace of development of antibiotics has slowed down dramatically over the past decades as the profitability of discovering the next antibiotic pales in comparison to discovery of new drugs to treat illnesses such diabetes, which will be required for a lifetime. This, coupled with rapid evolution of bacteria has resulted in a deadly problem—-antibiotic resistance, which has resulted in a large number of deaths due to inability of antibiotics to overcome these resistant bacteria. However, due to the fact that production of antibiotics is not as profitable, this is a problem, which remains unaddressed. Furthermore, HIV/AIDS, though responsible for over 5000 deaths daily, has not seen tremendous breakthrough in the area of research due to the lack of financial incentives. Clearly, financial incentives is not always accurate indicator of society’s most pressing issues and should thus not be employed in science. In conclusion, as far as possible, science and business should not be mixed. The commercialisation of science cheapens its pursuit and adulterates the noble intentions it was founded on—- the pursuit of truth to help mankind. Scientists should instead learn from Physician Edward Jenner, who had a heart of gold and refused to file a patent following his groundbreaking discovery of the smallpox vaccine, saying that it would prevent the poor from gaining access to it. As the saying goes, ‘ the love for money is the root of all evil,’ it is imperative that scientists are not driven by motives of greed and profit maximisation, but by the genuine drive to help others.",‘Science and business should never mix.’ How far do you agree?
Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,A,"An award winning photograph shot by Kevin Carter features a starving child being eyed hungrily by a vulture, a picture that accurately encapsulates the issue of world hunger today. With approximately a third of the world’s population living under the poverty line, it is no wonder that world hunger is such a pertinent issue today. While the advent of technology such as genetically engineered crops seems to be the most promising solution to world hunger, it is apparent that the corruption of officials and profit maximising objectives of firms have increasingly thwarted the promise of such technology in resolving world hunger, rendering its impact limited.  The advent of technology appeared to usher in the world’s effective panacea to world hunger, with the introduction of a cornucopia of genetically modified crops, seemingly resolving problems of malnutrition and starvation. Genetically modified produce such as that of frost resistant tomatoes and pest resistant lettuces have increased crop yield exponentially, which would otherwise be destroyed by pests and weather changes. The introduction of golden rice, which is rich in vitamin A, has increasingly eradicated malnutrition in several developing countries. In particular, benefits have been experienced by several inhabitants of African nations, many of who suffer from vitamin A deficiency. As such, advancements in technology have appeared to be the most effective and reliable solution to world hunger.  However, proponents of the view that technology is the most viable solution to world hunger overlooks the fact that successes in the production of genetically modified crops are few and far between, limiting its ability to impact world hunger. As leading British geneticist Steve Jones once aptly quipped, “We thought genetic engineering would solve all our problems, but that turned out to be a false dawn.” The pursuit of technological advancements has resulted in many failures, some even causing detrimental effects to the environment or even consumers. The incorporation of a gene in Brazil nuts into soybean caused several allergic reactions in consumers and had to be recalled. Moreover, the introduction of Bt corn caused huge damage to the ecosystem as it killed all insect larvae indiscriminately, instead of just crop-destroying ones. As such, the limited successes, coupled with failures of many failures of technology and genetic engineering render its impact on world hunger limited. Furthermore, effects of consumption of genetically engineered crops are still under investigation, as it is a fairly new domain. There are still several possible risks associated with it such as increased risks of cancer and mutations. These risks have given rise to many refusing to consume such food, thus limiting the ability of such technology to resolve world hunger.  In addition, corruption of officials and political leaders undermine the already small impact technology is making on world hunger. Approximately 40% of all food and financial aid sent to beneficiaries in developing countries is siphoned off by corrupt political leaders, and this figure could even reach 70% in African countries. As such, even if technology were granted free of charge, or the financial aid granted to harness technology to eradicate world hunger, it may not even reach beneficiaries. This severely limits its ability to solve world hunger. The 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia saw greedy officials pocket a large proportion of foreign financial aid provided to victims thus thwarting the goodwill of such countries. Furthermore, due to barriers established in countries such as North Korea, which houses a large proportion of the world’s impoverished, resistance to foreign aid have caused world hunger to persist in the country. In such nations, even though the financial resources may have been provided to obtain the technology required to reduce the issue of world hunger, it may not even reach intended beneficiaries due to corruption or political barriers erected.  Not only does technology have a limited impact on world hunger, the profit driven motives of research giants around the world may even exacerbate the issue. The profit driven motives of research institutions often cause such technology to be priced at unattainable levels, out of reach of the poor, causing them to function more like businesses rather than research institutions. A salient example would be Monsanto, which attached patents to genetically modified seeds it produced causing them to be priced at exorbitant levels. To make matters worse, these seeds were even engineered to be infertile, thus forcing farmers to purchase a new batch of seeds after every season. This caused many farmers to be mired in debt, while desperately clinging on to the promise of a large increase in crop yield. Many farmers eventually began to lose hope and some even committed suicide in desperation, leading to an increase in farmer suicides in India. Evidently, the profit driven motives of research giants have not only caused technology to be unable to eradicate world hunger, but also led to greater poverty, as farmers have to cough up exorbitant amounts of money to pay for genetically engineered produce, worsening the issue.  However, although hampered by corruption and profit driven institutions, it cannot be denied that technology has brought about some extent of impact to resolve world hunger, though limited. The use of technology to eradicate world hunger is a simplistic and symptomatic one that targets the effects of world hunger. Its use thus has to be combined with other strategies to ensure more effective impacts to resolve world hunger. In order for world hunger to be targeted successfully, it is imperative that we take the bull by its horns and target the fundamental flaws and root cause of world hunger. As the world population grows to unprecedented levels with an estimated 2.5 billion more mouths to feed by 2040, where most of the skyrocketing population is due to increases in population of developing countries, it is crucial that strategies that target population growth be implemented. Without such strategies, even with huge advancements in technology, the best possible outcome is an increase in crop yield. Even then, it cannot be guaranteed that the increase in crop yield can catch up to that of population growth. Hence, the effect of technology, unless used in conjunction with other strategies to control population growth, will always be limited.  In conclusion, technology, unless used with other strategies, has limited impacts on world hunger. Governments around the world should come together to address this pressing issue which is plaguing many societies today, with a child dying of hunger every 4 seconds. The use of technology to resolve world hunger should be administered with propriety, to ensure that the poor are given access to it without having to dig too deep into their pockets. Only then, will the impact of technology be maximised to resolve world hunger.",Consider the impact of technology on world hunger today.
Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,A,"The sale of Damien Hirst’s “The Core of God” – a diamond encrusted skull, which fetched a hefty price of US$100 million seemed to be nothing short of exuberant excess, landing many critics of it being an ‘unnecessary’ and ‘irrelevant’ waste of money. The man-on-the-street simply cannot understand the material value of a decorative piece of art reserved for the ultra rich while he is struggling to feed his family. Indeed, to the pragmatist, the Arts are simply something inherently useless and irrelevant with little value, and nothing more than an enjoyable pastime and a luxury to the rich. However, as modern world progresses far beyond seeking only economic pursuits, the Arts are increasingly relevant to people across the world as it helps to forge a strong social fabric in our diverse nation, is an increasingly powerful driver of our economy and, most importantly, inculcates important social values in our society.  The Arts have huge economic weight and have become increasingly relevant in society, especially given the rising bourgeois class in Asia and the increasing demand for intellectual discourse. The building of the esplanade has been a prudent investment as the booming arts industry has given Singapore greater international recognition. The arts scene is thus predicted to be the “Holy Grail” of the richer market that Singapore is incessantly in search of, while opening art institutes have boosted our economy as well, with up and coming local fashion designers and singers such as J. J. Lin, and even film maker Royston Tan, further enhancing our image and adding to our value as an attractive tourist hotspot, adding to its relevance as it further enhances our nation’s economic performance.  In our pragmatic and success-driven society, the Arts are also extremely relevant as one of the most powerful mediums to drive across important social values due to its ability to provoke thought and connect deeply with the raw emotions of each individual. The Arts, by portraying human nature and society, have taught us about who we are and what others are like, helping us to understand each other. Kevin Carter’s Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of a vulture lying in wait of a starving child in Sudan received much media attention because it brought to attention the desolate situation in third-world countries. This is evidenced by how over hundreds of readers from countries all across the globe, including Singapore, called The New York Times, which published the photograph, after seeing it, to enquire about the fate of the poor child. Their concern thus shows how the photograph was able to speak to people all across the globe in a relevant manner, including Singapore, and propagate important social values such as empathy and compassion towards the less fortunate. Clearly, the Arts force us to think, to question and reflect. Furthermore, literature such as Harper Lee’s ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ and Elizabeth George Speare’s ‘The Witch of Blackbird Pond’ have placed societal issues such as racial discrimination and minority persecution under the spotlight, enabling our understanding of the persecuted, and causing us to question our prejudices, thereby increasing empathy for others who may appear different from ourselves and suffer as a result, while teaching us basic kindness for other human beings. The ability of Arts to criticise, to touch us in places most raw and hidden, has enabled us to understand ourselves and our treatment of others, and in the process, led us to feel and empathise, making it extremely relevant to the masses. As the cosmopolitan city Singaporeans live in become increasingly diverse, the Arts can serve as an important platform for all to better understand each other and build a more cohesive society. In Singapore, although we enjoy relative harmony amongst the races, our collective memory as a young nation-state requires much more building. The “Mosaic model” the government adopted to serve the national interests of maintaining peace and stability after the 1960s ring hollow when the theory is not backed up with concrete action, such as promotion of cultural interaction of the diverse races through the Arts. Through celebrating the richness of unique art forms, for example, Malay dance and Indian folklore, citizens would gain a better understanding and emerge more unified over time. Our social fabric can only be kept intact if we appreciate and not just tolerate, the beauty of other cultures, through none other than the panoply of activities and products that best express the essence of our heritage – the Arts. The Arts has definitely increased in relevance, as it is one of the most effective means of maintaining our delicate social fabric, with our vibrant Arts scene promoting harmony amongst the melting pot of society.  Undoubtedly, the arts market in recent years has witnessed an exponential growth in profits, with major art auction houses such as Christie’s or Sotheby’s churning out exorbitant revenues of more than billions each year – equivalent to or even greater than the GDP of many impoverished countries. The investment placed in developing the arts, such as constructing theatres and paying for formal artistic training in all fields has spawned critics who view the Arts as nothing more than a luxury reserved for the upper echelons of society, irrelevant to the masses.  Technocrats would argue that it is definitely more prudent to focus on developing the economy and putting more money into scientific research so as to increase our competitiveness in the global arena. Areas such as biotechnology have been pinpointed as the ‘next big thing’ that will affirm Singapore’s status on the world stage and generate substantial employment, eventually trickling down to improve the wellbeing of everyone. On the other hand, the Arts are but a strain on the nation’s financial resources and are merely an additional form of entertainment and luxury to the rich, whatever benefits it has to offer unattainable and thus, irrelevant to the masses. However, the Arts cannot be merely seen through the tinted lenses of the obstinate pragmatist who view the Arts as nothing more than a preserve of the rich. In the distant past, the Arts were the special province of the aristocrats and high society, however, in today’s egalitarian world, the Arts have descended from their ivory tower to the masses. For example, many people can walk into Golden Village or The Cathay and afford a movie for an affordable price of $13. The government has taken advantage of the growing popularity of the Arts by making it more accessible to the masses through means such as affordable dance performances or movie screenings at neighbourhood community centres. The Arts have evidently become increasingly democratized and thus, more relevant to the masses.  The Arts are certainly relevant and effective in reaching out to the masses. Singapore can seek to become an ‘artistic hub’, instead of a mere financial centre labelled by critics as a ‘cultural desert’. As Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong aptly commented, ”Men do not live by bread alone.” Indeed, it is the Arts that endow us with many perceptive insights and teaches us to find meaning in life hence it should definitely be democratized and made more accessible to the masses.","‘In today’s world, the arts have become irrelevant. ’ How far do you agree?"
Ying,Raffles Institution,2020,A,"Every three seconds, a child dies of poverty. With 5% of the world’s income distributed in the hands of 95% of the world’s population, poverty is indeed one of the scourges of mankind that has been plaguing society since time immemorial. To state that poverty is the fault of the individual is to connote that the poor have full control over their plight and therefore, should bear full responsibility for it. However, more often than not, the poor are born into their financial situation by a slew of dire social problems caused by governments, religious groups and international groups, over which they have no control.  Detractors may claim that the poor are to blame for their plight due to their failure to leverage on available financial schemes and work their way out of poverty. Such people believe sheer grit and determination to be the panacea to poverty. After all, Singapore leapfrogged from a third world country to the thriving metropolis it is today in barely half a century based on the tenet that ‘nobody owes us a living’, which has indeed served us well. With the presence of many welfare schemes such as financial aid in many Scandinavian countries and skills upgrading workshops in Singapore such as Skills future, it is convenient to assume that the poor have simply bypassed such opportunities and therefore should be blamed for their plight. Critics cite many rags to riches stories, such as that of Steve Jobs, to buttress their point. At a superficial level, it seems that the poor have simply not taken the opportunity to break the poverty cycle and thus should be blamed for their financial situation.  However, closer examination of the situation reveals that there are many simplifying assumptions the argument has made which does not hold water. While it is indeed convenient to assume that the poor have simply bypassed such opportunities due to sloth, it must be noted that these opportunities are few and far between. While many affluent countries have welfare schemes put in place, the same cannot be said for many developing countries such as India, which house a large proportion of the world’s impoverished. A salient example is Ethiopia, where majority of the citizens live under the poverty line of USD2 a day. Such countries lack basic infrastructure, let alone welfare schemes. The poor are thus left to struggle with their own vices; helpless in the face of such unfortunate situations they were born into. Given the lack of control over the environment they were born into and thus the presence of financial aid, it would be foolhardy to blame them for their financial situation.  Furthermore, the situation is made worse by corrupt governments, or those swaddled so firmly in red tape that removes any opportunity presented for the poor to break out of their plight. The earthquake that hit Southeast Asia in 2004 saw 40% of foreign aid being siphoned off by greedy officials. This figure could climb to as high as 90% in African nations. In such cases, the poor are not even granted access to basic necessities, let alone the opportunity for social mobility. The poor, with no political influence against their leaders, are unable to revolt against such unfair ruling and are left defenceless against such heartless officials. The lack of access to education makes matters worse – some may not even be aware of such corruption-taking place and continue to suffer in silence, perpetuating the cycle. To blame the poor in this case would be grossly unjustified, given their helplessness in the face of such an unfeeling establishment.  Moreover, the presences of radical religious groups that hold on to patriarchal values further deepen the plight of the poor. In countries in the Middle East such as Libya and Egypt, girls who have hit puberty are not allowed to continue schooling, due to religious beliefs that demand separation of the sexes. This resulted in less than half of the population of girls in Egypt being literate and an even lower employment rate, further trapping the poor in the vicious poverty cycle. The poor are left defenceless in the face of such religious fanatics, who use violence to ensure compliance. Many poor children, when interviewed by newscasters, express a thirst for education, however any effort on their part is quickly rendered immaterial by such backward beliefs adopted by society. Surely this absolves the poor of any blame, given their helplessness in the face of such unjust conditions, over which they have no power to protest against.  To further compound the issue, international forces have also contributed to the problem. Food dumping by developed countries such as the USA, as well as the establishment of protectionist measures likes trade embargoes have further reduced the ability of the poor to trade and earn revenue. In a bid to line their pockets, many large international multinational corporations such as Nike and Gap have also depressed wages of labourers and some have even resorted to the use of cheap child labour. Owing to the selfish profit driven motives of firms, some workers have even been forced to endure more than 12 hours of arduous menial work under harsh conditions, while earning less than USD1 per hour. The poor, eager to work their way out of poverty, subject themselves to such inhumane treatment in an attempt to make a living. However, majority end up working an inordinate number of hours, resulting in deteriorating health and yet still find themselves entrenched in the depths of poverty. It would be unfair to fault the poor in this situation, given the inexorable forces that have contributed to their misery.  Ultimately, poverty is a multi-faceted issue caused by panoply of social issues over which the poor have no say. The systemic nature of the poverty cycle renders poverty a birthmark rather than a choice. Instead of quibbling over who should take the lion’s share of the blame, we should start taking action and join the fight against poverty.",To what extent is poverty the fault of the individual?
Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2020,A,"“This most beautiful system of the sun, planets and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being.” These words were from Sir Isac Newton, one of the most influential scientists of all time who was a key figure in the scientific revolution. He established the Three Laws of Motion, law of universal gravitation, study of optics and many other discoveries that advanced science to where it is today. His view on religion, however, may be seen by some as less relevant today. Religion appears to be on the decline as scientific facts uncover more truths of our world. However, scientific faith can never fully replace religious faith due to the differing function each one serves, the increased need for religion as a moral compass and the relevance of religion in uniting communities. Detractors may argue that there is a trend of religion being on the decline with dwindling attendance in places of worship and an ever growing population of atheists. This could be attributed to the fact that science makes use of empirical observation to explain many natural phenomena. Religion is therefore no longer required to explain occurences such as the rising of the sun, the planets and natural disasters. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis were once believed to be manifestations of God’s wrath but scientific research has proven that they are in fact naturally-occuring. This reduced the legitimacy of religion. With increased expousre to such Western modes of education and philosophical inquiry, people are beginning to question their faiths. Many religious beliefs are at odds with the presence and progress in the scientific field. For example the Genesis account of creation conflicts with Darwin’s Theory of evolution. Advancements of science has also led to benefits for mankind, elevating science to a grander status. On the otherhand, religion has impeded scientific progress with one example being the banning of stem cell research in US and EU due to objections by the Catholic Church. However, science continues to advance and modern medicine has replaced traditional religious methods. The value of religion may be undermined as it is viewed to be irrelevant and groudless. However, it can be seen that religion continues to prevail despite these scientific facts and evidence. Religion flourishes in many parts of the world and are still sought out by people. 24% of the world population still identify with a religious group and of the people without religious affiliation, most still have a strong sense of spirituality or belief in God. In Scandinavia, most people say they do not believe in God but paranormal and superstition beliefs tend to be higher than expected. Witchcraft is gaining popularity in US while paganism is the fastest growing religions in UK. In many communities, religion acts a uniting force for communities and allow people from different social classes to come together. Religious sites and historical places of worship are well conserved under UNESCO, showing the unwavering relevance of religion. Even with the advancement of science, religious beliefs in the supernatural are not yet obsolete. In Indonesia, volcanoes have a spiritual significance, each with a myth associated with it. Volcanoes are honoured with festivals and offerings by the local people. Sultans in Yogyakarta also play a special role to ensure the sacred alignment between the volcano, the palace in the middle and the Indian Ocean, thus ensuring the safety of the people. Similarly, other communities also continue to have faith in religion and conduct traditional rituals for prosperity and peace.  It can be seen that the advancement of science will not lead to religion’s decline because they are not mutually exclusive, neither do they serve the same function. William H Bragg once said, “From religion comes a man’s purpose; from science, his power to achieve it.” Science is concerned with the processes that account for the natural world but religion has nothing definitive to say about them. It is concerned with the meaning and purpose of the world and human life, contemplating moral and ethical values. Genesis is a book of religious revelations and teachings, not a treatise on astronomy and biology. Hence, it is not contrary to scientific cosmology and evolution. Unlike science that provides cold hard truth, religion is a source of comfort for people as it relies on faith and hope. During the financial crisis of 2008, more people turned to religion to seek help and get through the tough times. By appealing to the emotions, religion has also been employed by political groups to gain supporters and fulfill their political agenda. For instance, Donald Trump portrayed himself as a defender of faith for Evangelicals and tried to paint his democratic rivals as threats to religious liberty to gain support ahead of the 2020 elections. Hence, science and religion serve different functions and a recent study of 100000 religious individuals found that only 27% felt that both were at odds with each other. People of faith can stand in awe of wondrous achievements of science and many scientists are also actively pursuing and uncovering the truth of our natural world using religion as their motivating factor.  With increase exploitation of technology derived from scientific advancement, religion is also needed more than ever to act as a moral compass to prevent corruption of humanity. This makes it more relevant and prevents its decline. With consumerism rising, there is an ever increasing emphasis on material aspects of life. Greedy corporations exploit consumers with high prices of drugs meant to save lives. Scientific research is invested in development of weapon technology to kill. There are fraud scientists such as Huang Woo Suk who fabricate results and spread lies for personal fame and glory. Religion is needed to serve as a guide to human behaviour and instill values in people to do he right thing. The Ten Commandments from Christianity and Judaism teach their folllowers how to live their life and prohibit acts of murder, theft and adultery. In Buddhism, virtuous behaviour is needed for moral purity and rebirth. Its believers are  motivated to do good in the world. Religion thus plays a part in influencing people’s moral code. With increasing power to alter nature through means such as genetic engineering, ethical boundaries are pushed. Such research threatens to make a huge impact on society’s way of life and threaten the harmony in society. Religion is needed to prevent the unfettered development of science so that it is used to improve society instead of causing new problems.  In conclusion, “Science can purify religion from error and superstition. Religion can purify science from idolatry and false absolutes”. This quote by Pope John Paul II highlights how science and religion work together and are not at odds with each other. Religion has been with humanity since the very beginning with the important functions it plays in society of setting moral guidelines and giving a sense of comfort. It thus shall retain its relevance and not decline.","The more science advances, the more religion will decline. To what extent do you agree?"
Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2020,A,"The Henn na Hotel in Japan is the world’s first robot-staffed hotel that employs cutting-edge technology and aims to serve customers a stress free experience. A customer is first greeted by robot dinosaurs, then has his things taken up by another robot to his room cleaned also by a robot. Its owner aims to make this the most efficient hotel in the world by reducing manpower and having 90 percent of the staff be robotic. Emerging innovation in fields such as robotics, artificial intelligence, biotechnology is revolutionising the efficiency of workforces and improving the quality of life and income of people all over the world. Although the idea of robots taking over the role of human beings is not universally embraced, the positive implications it brings to the economy, governments and people outweigh its negative consequences. Hence, the idea of robots replacing human beings in the workplace should be welcomed instead of resisted. Companies might welcome the use of robots as they provide low-cost alternatives to labour and increased efficiency to increase profits. Robots are able to do work that takes humans longer time and greater effort. John Deere is an agricultural company that uses self-driving tractors. This reduces the need for people to man the machinery. It also has a lettuce farming robot that is capable of identifying unwanted plants, and shooting them with deadly, high-precision squirts of herbicide. Such robotic technology is increasingly employed in the agricultural sector, an industry once highly labour-intensive. Self-checkout counters are also becoming more commonly seen in supermarkets. This reduces the number of cashiers needed and can improve the shopping experience for customers through increasing the number of counters and reducing their queuing time. Especially with the hectic lifestyle of many working class nowadays, this option is preferred and increases the popularity of the supermarket. Automation by robots is also becoming common in airports. A study by international Air Transport Association found that moving to fully automated check-in baggage system saves the industry $1.6 billion a year since the cost per customer of a using a staffed check in desk is $3 but with a machine, this drops to 14 cents. In the food and beverage industry, Momentum Machines have developed a robot that can produce 400 hamburgers in an hour while fully autonomous, from slicing toppings to grilling to assembling and packaging. Hence, it is evident that a great range of industries are welcoming robots into the workforce to improve efficiency and become more profitable. We should also welcome the idea of robots replacing humans in doing routine, predictable type and precision tasks. This can free up humans to do tasks in innovation or customer service, more suited to human strengths. Amazon is trying out the use of Kiva robots in its warehouses to pick up merchandise and fulfill orders. In the past, there was a report on how the efficiency of human Amazon workers were tracked. This created a lot of pressure on the workers to perform well resulting in poor working experiences for them. Work in agriculture also used to be very tedious as it involved back breaking work for humans. However, with the use of robots, tough jobs can be handled by them, relieving humans of hard labour. Ecrobotix, a Swiss technology firm has a solar-controlled bot that not only can identify weeds but thereafter can treat them. Naio Technologies based in southwestern France has developed a robot with the ability to weed, hoe, and assist during harvesting. Energid Technologies based in Cambridge, Massachusetts has developed a citrus picking system that retrieves one piece of fruit every 2-3 seconds. Meanwhile, Blue River Technology has developed the LettuceBot2 that attaches itself to a tractor to thin out lettuce fields as well as prevent herbicide-resistant weeds. Robots being programmed to do these tedious, mundane tasks have allowed people to move on to higher-level jobs that will prove more fulfilling. Society should also welcome the use of robots because they possess the capability to surpass what humans can accomplish. The use of cutting edge robotic technology can improve the effectiveness and quality of work as the robots posess special skills. In the medical field, the Da Vinci Surgical System scales down a surgeon’s hand movements to let him make tiny incision. This creates less tissue damage and lead to a quicker recovery. This allows for better quality of healthcare treatment for the people. A faster recovery means more bed space and reduction in the problem of space shortage in many hospitals all over the world. The Flex Robotic System developed by Medrobotics are equipped with a high definition camera and can bend to conform to the patient’s anatomy and guide instruments through a patients body. An implication of this is that humans and robots can work together in increasing the quality of work produced. Doctors at a Children’s National Health System in Washington have developed a smart tissue autonomous robot (STAR) that requires only light human supervision. It has carried out successful operations on piglets. In the future, this robot technology might be developed such that it can conduct surgeries on humans. This reduces the shortage on surgeons and patients will have less waiting time in receiving surgeries. Healthcare is also currently very expensive and takes a big toll on government expenses. The use of robots with advanced capabilities and lower cost can reduce the financial burden. However, the idea of replacing human beings will be resisted by workers for fear of losing their jobs to robots. There is a likely consequence of hollowing out of middle income jobs. These middle income jobs can be easily replaced by robots and artificial intelligence. Though there may be jobs to satisfy demand, new jobs created by automation might be lower-skilled and lower paid, thus creating a polarisation of income. Many cases of retrenchments have emerged. Foxconn, the supplier of Apple and Samsung has cut 60000 factory workers and replaced them with robots. By 2018, an estimated 90% of transactions used to be performed by tellers are already done through ATM. This is due to the rise of customers turning more to mobile banking and ATMs instead of the actual bank tellers.  Nevertheless, new innovation creates more jobs than destroys them. The employment of robots in the workplace is unlikely to cause the widespread unemployment or wage disparity as feared due to the policies in place to support human labour in the face of such technological changes. More countries are investing in training opportunities that equip workers with skills to perform new tasks created by automation. Reivision of the tax code reduces subsidies directed towards capital relative to labour. This minimizes incentives to inefficiently substitute capital for labour. This also slows down the take up of robots in the workforce allowing lag time for workers to gain skills and adapt. In addition, wage subsidies are also directed towards technology that develops new tasks to allow people to earn a living wage and retain some level of meaning and dignity. With all the policies in place, fears of robots making all human labour obsolete are unfounded and hence the idea of robots replacing human beings for certain jobs ought to still be welcomed. In conclusion, the future of the workforce is going to require the balance between robots replacing labour and robots creating new job opportunities. With advancement of technology and research, the features and capabilities of robots will only improve. The benefits it brings to the workforce and economy greatly outweighs the negative consequences. Resisting this inevitable shift in the system is futile so welcoming them in the workplace is necessary to adapt with the changes.",Should we welcome or resist the idea of robots replacing human beings in the workplace?
Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2020,A,"Albert Einstein once said, “It is appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.” With the development of many assisted reproductive technology, more people are having children by artificial means. This raises many ethical concerns surrounding our existence, as well as what makes us human. Assisted reproductive technologies include in-vitro fertilisation, inseminate surrogacies or gestational surrogacies. It has successfully treated infertile couples, providing them with the opportunity to have a child. 3.4 million children have been born worldwide through artificial means, with the utilisation of such technology increasing at a rate of 5-10% annually in developed countries. However, people should not be allowed to have children by these artificial means due to the ethical dilemmas raised in terms of embryo disposal and ownership, and the negative consequences this brings to both the patients and society.  Firstly, artificial means of reproduction crosses paths with several ethical issues due to the ambiguity on what to do with unused embryos. In the invitro fertilisation (IVF) process, several eggs and sperms are fertilised but only a few are selected to be implanted in the womb. Some believe that human life begins at conception and hence embryos should be treated with utmost care. The destroying of embryos is equivalent to killing of potential life forms and tantamount to murder. Different countries have different policies to dealing with unused embryos. In Britain, unclaimed embryos must be destroyed with 5 years of creation. Official statistics show that more than one million of these “leftover” embryos created for fertility treatment have been destroyed over the past 14 years. In the US, there are no federal regulations or statutes governing the disposition of frozen embryos created through IVF. Over 600000 cryopreserved embryos are stored in fertility clinics across the US. Couples who conceived through IVF may grow to view the additional embryos as additional lives and struggle with how to deal with them. This exerts a psychological toll on them especially if the couple has varying views or face pressure from others, eg. parents and friends. A study by Journal Fertility and Sterility reported after a successful IVF treatment, most of the couples surveyed expressed dissatisfaction with the education obtained from health care providers about disposal decisions. Therefore, the artificial means of reproduction should not be allowed as many potential lives of many surplus embryos have been sacrificed.  In addition, assisted reproductive technologies also create issues on the ownership of the embryo or the female body. It commercialises human reproduction and created a host of complicated moral problems without answers. Such ethical issues tend to arise with frozen embryos, such as when one member of the couple wants to have a child but the other does not. This is typical of couples who have broken up. A controversial case is that of Natalie Evans who was unable to have children due to her previous treatment for ovarian cancer. She wanted to use frozen embryos created with her former partner but he refused. She eventually lost the court case and the law required both to give consent before embryos can be implanted. Such dilemma would not have arisen if these artificial methods were not available in the first place. Also on the issue of embryos, some couples decide to donate their unused ones to other couples. This may lead to the controversial practice of creating batches of embryos and sharing them among several families. There is a higher chance of children unknowingly meeting and marrying their siblings. There may also be the commercialisation of embryos and more embryos will be created but not used. Clinic may buy eggs and sperms from donors whose profiles are likely to have broad appeal, such as being well-educated or having good looks. This buying and selling of gametes is considered immoral. Other forms of assisted reproduction include surrogacy. Many surrogate mothers are poor, uneducated, and easily exploited for their reproduction potential. They may be motivated by financial pressures.A surrogate in Ukraine, for examples, earns up to $20000 which is more than eight times the average yearly income. However, they may be kept unaware of the health risks and the emotional attachment they form with the infant that is not easily compensated by financial rewards. There have been reports of poor treatment of surrogate mothers, with some agencies refusing to pay surrogates if they do not obey strict requirements or if they miscarry. Hence, these artificial means of reproduction should not be allowed due to the many problems caused to parties involved.  Artificial means of having children also give rise to more new possibilities that cross ethical lines. For instance, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) involves embryos from IVF that have their blastomere removed at an early stage. The cell can then be tested for the presence or absence of a previously identified genetic condition. This is a method of selecting which embryos to place in a woman by determining which embryos have a chance of becoming children if implanted successfully. It is used to avoid children with serious early onset inherited disorders eg. Tay-Sachs disease. However, it is morally unacceptable that people are getting to choose what kind of children are to be born or not. The detection of disease is extending to bowel cancer, breast cancer and might not stop there. In the future, it may end up being used to check for all other genetic diseases, prevent being carriers of harmful recessive alleles, or even confer positive traits. This is similar to “playing God” and gives more power to technological interferences in creating the child. Such power is dangerous because humans lack enough knowledge to know what traits are good and beneficial to humanity. Giving parents the choice for traits such as gender can skew gender proportions in some nations if conducted on a large scale. There is an urgent need for limits and setting up of governing bodies worldwide such as the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in UK. Without which, allowing children to have artificial means may cause detriment society as it breaches ethical guidelines.  The artificial means of reproduction also pose a health risk to the mother, egg donor and babies. Drugs that stimulate ovulation pose a surgical risk of ovarian hyper stimulation and egg donors are inadequately informed. Many women who seek IVF treatment are also older and more at risk of an unfavourable pregnancy compared to women able to conceive naturally at a younger age. This option of reproduction by IVF has increased mortality rates of pregnancy. IVF also causes other side effects such as ectopic pregnancy that is life threatening. There is also an increased chance of premature birth and birth defects such as anatomic abnormalities and imprinting errors. Findings by the British government revealed that IVF babies have a 30% higher chance of genetic deformity. With the lack of long term safety data and little research on the health problems posed by assisted reproductive technologies, more advocacy groups are calling for more research. This can help people make more informed decisions about having children artificially as the birth defects may result in an unacceptable quality of life that is undesitable.  Some may argue that people should still be allowed to decide whether they want to have children, as this is a matter of free choice. Since such technologies are available to make it possible for people to overcome infertility and reproduce, they have a choice to adopt these methods. Only around 5% of the world population voluntarily decides to be childless. Those wishing to conceive but cannot suffer emotionally and psychologically, even resulting in distress, anxiety and depression. These methods also provide a chance for singles or same-sex couples to have a child of their own and fulfill their paternal or maternal instincts. They should not allow the tyranny of majority and support the freedom of choice. The Proclamation of Teheran recognizes the right to reproduce and acknowledges that parents have the right to decide on their choices of family planning. The American Civil Liberties Union also fights to defend an individual’s reproductive right. It believes that religion should not be a legitimate reason for denying people reproductive rights. However, there are alternatives to having children such as adoption. Many children are in need of a home. For instance, many children in Cambodia are orphaned by years of war and in China, many females were abandoned due to the one-child policy. Mindsets should also be changed to be accepting of infertility and society should reduce the pressure to have children as fulfillment need not only come from parenthood. To conclude, though the artificial means have given hope to millions of couples suffering from infertility, they have also presented new ethical, legal and social questions that society must address. The unresolved issues need to be resolved in future social and legal dialogue before more people have children through such means. Legislation is typically unable to keep up with rapidly changing technology. It is necessary that couples think hard about this deeply personal and important choice before deciding to undergo the various processes. Hence at the moment, it is my belief that people should not be allowed to have children by artificial means.",Should people be allowed to have children by artificial means?
Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2020,A,"“Whoever controls the media, controls the mind”. This quote by Jim Morrisson shows how news agencies, the government, or large corporations who have control over the media are able to influence people’s thoughts and opinions on certain topics. The mass media is inescapable, an all-pervasive presence in modern living. People are exposed to it through traditional forms such as television, newspapers, radio, books, as well as digital electronic forms of blogs, social media sites, and videos. Allowing one to access and acquire information, society can be educated and stay up to date on the happenings of the world. However, the media cannot always be relied upon to provide accurate, unbiased truths, and to uphold social responsibility. People need to be able to discern information wisely because media is inherently drive by profits, centrally controlled by powerful governments and subject to manipulation by ill-intentioned organisations and individuals.  The profit-driven nature of media makes it unreliable in upholding social responsibility and providing truthful information as they tend to sensationalise headlines and news stories. The vested interests of the media make them increasingly driven by ratings and profits. In a bid to generate hype, news outlets tend to practice sensationalism and cannot be trusted to regulate themselves. There is increasing voyeurism and it tends to toe the line of what is acceptable. For instance, The Times published a photograph of a woman, Katherine Ward, in mid-fall to her death from a London hotel window ledge. Horrendous images of bombings by Al-Qaeda also appeared on Spanish television. This promotion of violence and sexuality can lead to a desensitisation to such issues. Depicting sex and violence as glamorous also increases the crime rates in society. Media outlets also tend to only publish what they believe their audience wants to see. The Danish newspaper commissioned and printed cartoons portraying the Prophet Muhammed in a bad light. They did not care about the social implications of their actions, resulting in growing hostility between Denmark’s immigrants and locals. This pushed anti-immigrant policies and sparked protests and riots, causing social unrest. The media also uses click-baits or tweaks information in news articles to make it more appealing. An analysis of 32 news articles by research John McManus found over half of news articles were misleading to increase the story’s appeal, or oversimplified a story so it could be told in two minutes. Therefore, the media cannot be trusted to provide truthful information. The media also cannot be trusted because it is used by governments through the covering up of information and propaganda to fuel their political agenda. Through various forms like national television and newspapers, extreme propaganda has been used throughout the course of modern history to gently alter people’s perceptions of others and themselves. In World war 2, Hitler gained control of Germany by using media to turn the country against Jews. His propaganda on national TV broadcasted his aim to create the “super race” of Germans- “Aryans”. PAP also controls Singapore media like Straits Times and uses it to cover up their mistakes or downplay any problems faced. The Great Firewall of China bans any information that challenges or expresses discontent with the regime in power. This prevents citizens from questioning the existing status quo. Information sharing sites such as Facebook and Twitter that promote free speech and allow spreading of ideas are banned in China to prevent threats to the country’s system. Searching about politically sensitive topics such as Tiananmen Square on Chinese search engine throws up vastly different image and texts from searching on the International google. This stops citizens from learning about historical events that can cause them to turn against their government. Such instances of governments manipulating the media to serve their needs can be seen in even more countries such as the censorship of media in Japan to create generations of Japanese who grew up unaware of the obscenities of Japan’s war past. North Korean journalists undergo ideological training every week where they are being updated on the latest ‘news’ they are allowed to publish to establish North Korea’s superiority and unquestionable authority of their leader. Since the media is often used as a tool for governments to shape the minds of citizens, it cannot always be trusted. Media cannot be trusted because it alters reality and twists the truth to intentionally deceive and manipulate actions of consumers. Advertisements account for 60% of newspaper and magazine profits and 100% for that of electronic media production. They have distorted the idea of beauty and aesthetics.Slimming advertisements use before and after photos where the before photo looks especially unattractive, with the photographed wearing unsuitable clothes or having poor body posture. However, the after photos were taken with makeup and nicer clothes to create a more stark contrast. The use of Photoshop to create flawless skin and reduced sizes has led to unrealistic beauty standards for women and created the culture of self-hatred. This is exploiting people’s vulnerabilities to create false and materialistic demands. People end up buying and spending more than they need because they equate personal worth to material possessions. In the consumeristic society, people compete to get bigger and better cars, houses, electronic gadgets. Media also glamorises unhealthy lifestyles such as the portrayal of smoking and drinking as glamorous or desirable. It also downplays healthy diets such as the Slim 10 diet pills, advertised to be safe and effective. However, they turned out to have adverse effects on consumers’ health and many died of liver failure.  Nevertheless, some may argue that the media can be trusted because it is still produced and distributed by responsible people, as well as subject to checks and balances by new media. Most jouralists are ethical and still want to give the truth. There are also many news agencies out there so no one agency can deliberately engage in unethical reporting because they risk being uncovered and losing viewership. New technologies of blogs and forums also provide alternatives to stop mainstream airing of political views. In the Wikileaks incident, Julian Assange released over 76k secret documents exposing US intelligent operatives and 100 Afghan informants. Hacktivist group Anonymous hacked various government websites and major security corporations. These new forms of media shone light on the lies kept from the public and thus can be trusted to provide truth to the people. In addition, during the cruel crackdown of the military junta in Myanmar, the Myanmar representative told UN that they were trying to protect political stability by stamping out violent instigators. However, images taken by a 3G video phone proved that the “violent instigators” were in fact monks in saffron ropes holding a peaceful demonstration. What the Myanmar government was insisting on fake and new media prevented them from propagating falsehoods. The conspiracy of Monsanto about using a harmful growth hormone was also uncovered by reporters of Fox News, Jane Akre and Steve Wilson. They were sacked to prevent the story from leaking but their story eventually found circulation through independently produced documentaries like Corporation, websites and alternative radio stations. Hence, even if mainstream news outlets are not truthful, there are still journalists with integrity and independent companies that wish to provide truthful and trustworthy information to people.  However, the rise of new media has made it even easier for one to propagate lies, making media even less reliable. A small town in Balkans called Veles has been accused of peddling fictitious stories, with the creators of such fake news, namely youths earning up to £1,500 a month. In the Pizzagate incident in 2016, an enraged middle aged men stormed a pizzeria and opened shots, injuring a few in the process. He was informed by a dubious alt-right news group that allegedly claimed that the Pizzeria was a guise for Hillary Clinton’s covert sex ring that was trafficking young and innocent children. Such a lie may seem absurd but is in fact believable to some people, posing a threat to society. Another incident in Germany where news of an immigrant raping a girl (Lisa F) sparked widespread protest and flash points as the far-right used it to fuel anti-immigrant sentiment. While the event was later discovered to be fabricated, the ramifications had already caused widespread panic and even hatred between communities. In July 2011, FoxNews apparently became a victim of hacking, with its politics Twitter feed repeatedly announcing President Barack Obama had been shot dead. The twitter account @foxnewspolitics began tweeting the info to its 33000 followers, with the posts rapidly being shared around the internet. Such fake news have great power to cause panic and social disharmony in society. With the ease of such fake news being created, the media cannot be trusted. The ubiquitous presence of mass media in our everyday lives makes it an undeniable and ineluctable influence on values. It has infiltrated every nook and cranny of our lives, subtly exerting its power and moulding our values. It cannot be trusted because its primary interests does not lie with the welfare of society. There is thus a need to be vigilant to maintain the standards and values of society. With increasing globalisation and rise of new media, this is all the more necessary.",Do you agree that we cannot trust the media?
Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2020,A,"In 2018, Singapore’s health database was the target of a deliberate and well-planned attack. It is one of the major data breaches of the Singapore government with personal data of over 1.5 million patients stolen by hackers. Singapore has always prided itself on its security and safety. As it moves towards being a SmartNation, the Singapore government and that of others all around the world need to be aware of the increased threats present due to the connectivity of the Internet. The Internet poses more problems in governance as there are more chances for crime, fake news can spread more easily and there is a platform for people to voice their opinions freely. The Internet presents more opportunities for criminals to commit crimes. Criminal entrepreneurs make use of modern technology of Internet to commit crimes with greater ease. They are able to hide behind a screen to remain anonymous and prevent their identity from being revealed. Money laundering has grown tenfold since 1990, reaching around $1-$1.5 trillion today. There is also a rise in cyber crimes such as online credit card fraud and cyber predators. Figures show that 4 billion is lost in credit card fraud, and an FBI report showed that 90% of 500 companies surveyed reported security breach and 80% financial loss. The Internet has also facilitated illicit trade by increasing the ease of communication between organisation. The rise of cryptocurrencies has further added to its appeal to criminals since they can keep their identities and purchase histories hidden. This makes it more difficult for governments to track down and put a stop to these illegal activities. Law enforcement becomes a challenge and governments need to find new ways to infiltrate the underground markets. Much personal data is also put online and made vulnerable to hackers. In addition to the Singhealth data breach, the medical records of 14200 HIV positive people have also been illegally disclosed online by deported American fraudster Brochez. Hence, governments need to step up cyber security and put in extra measures to maintain security and privacy of its citizens.  The Internet also propagates fake news that makes it hard for governments to control. Fake news have the ability to incite fear and public alarm in society. The fake report of a roof collapse at a housing board in Punggol on online site SG stuff caused panic in many residents. Grassroot leaders, as well as SPF and SCDF rushed down to the site only to find that it was a hoax. This is just an example of a harmless prank that simply causes trouble and annoyance to people. In more serious cases, fake news can be used to manipulate people and draw divides in the society. There was an incident in Germany where news of an immigrant raping a girl (Lisa F) sparked widespread protest and flash points as the far-right used it to fuel anti-immigrant sentiment. While the event was later discovered to be fabricated, the ramifications had already caused widespread panic and even hatred between communities. Fake news has also influenced results of presidential campaigns and important referendums, undermining the democratic process. An analysis showed that in the US presidential campaign, fake news articles received more engagement than those from reliable outlets. They could swing voters by spreading misinformation about the government to create tension between the government and people. With technology rapidly advancing such as the rise of deepfakes, where people manage to alter an existing photo or video through artificial means, governments have been stepping up measures to prevent fake news from causing more problems to society. It is an additional challenge that they need to overcome to maintain the harmony and their own integrity. This is done through fake news laws such as the Protection from Online Falsehood and Manipulation Bill in Singapore or the Against Information Manipulation law in France. Governments also put pressure on big technological companies to put measures to combat fake information.  The diversity of views on the Internet also makes it harder for the government to govern today. Social media has proved itself a powerful tool of expressing oneself. It is a platform for one to say almost anything and connect with others with similar views. Its great impact can be seen in how it helped in toppling authoritarian governments during the Arab Spring Revolution. With the rise of Internet, people will become more exposed to views outside of their country and begin to question the status quo, threatening the position of the governments in power. Governments hence need to either quench those views or find a way to gain the trust of the people. The range of views online also include extremist beliefs that tend to result in terrorism. ISIS is known to recruit from online and they feed on the dissatisfaction and dissent against authority. Things can be easily obscured on the dark web so the detection of radicalised individuals are not often done soon enough, hence the extremist ideology spreads. Some governments attempt to clamp down on the freedom of speech on the Internet to maintain the social fabric. For example, The Great Firewall of China bans any information that challenges or expresses discontent with the regime in power. However, this is not always successful because citizens end up finding a way to get around it, such as through the downloading of VPNs. The variety of opinions is something that the governments need to deal with in governance through ensuring that everyone feels like they have a voice and are heard. They also need to ensure that differing views are not offensive and will not result in faultlines or conflicts between different groups in the community.  However, the Internet has a wide outreach and can be of assistance to governments in governing. For instance, the Internet can help in sharing information to the public. The Singapore government uses the Internet and social media for its campaign such as in preventing diabetes or curbing gambling addiction. They are able to reach out to their target audience very effectively. The Internet is also often used to  conduct surveys and gather opinions of people. It has become more convenient to receive feedback from the people through online means then by traditional methods of stopping people on the streets or going door to door. With more voices heard from the people, better decisions can be made and the country will be a better democracy. There is also the rise of E-voting in countries like Estonia and Canada. This makes voting convenient and accessible to more people, increasing the voter turn out rate. It also benefits the people as they are able to change their votes as many times as they would like until the final moment. Hence, there are advantages brought to governments by the Internet that aid them in governing. To conclude, the Internet has become an integral part of our everyday life, bringing in greater convenience and accessibility to citizens. However, it has generated more problems that the government has to deal with such as increased chance for crimes, fake news and diverse views. This has made it more difficult for governments to govern today. They must hence learn to navigate these new waters and adapt to the changing times to continue to fulfill the needs of the people, as well as to maintain the security and social harmony of society.",“The Internet makes it more difficult for governments to govern today.” How far do you agree with this statement?
Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2020,A,"Advancements in this century have led to the widespread usage of new media such as the Internet. Social networking sites, online news sites and blogs have dramatically reduced the use of traditional media, as seen by the sharp decrease in circulation of print newspapers in recent years. With majority of people in developed countries owning a smartphone, the world population has become highly wired. This has shifted the values of people and made drastic changes to peoples’ lives politically, economically and socially. New media has firstly allowed for individuals to have entrepreneurial spirit and encouraged innovation globally. The instantaneous speed of new media has changed the way people do business and companies have been adapting to the rise of social media to maintain relevant in the fast-paced society. With efficiency and convenience becoming highly valued in society, new applications have emerged that seek to fulfill this need such as ride-hailing, online shopping and food delivery apps. Entrepreneurship has also become more global. Local firms are able to more easily aim global, such as GoJek, an indonesian firm spreading regionally and in the future, globally. Coding and app creation are also becoming essential skills. More and more people are able to create apps and strike it rich. For instance, the Snapchat co-founder and CEO was only in his 20s when he became a billionaire. This shows that new media has provided the opportunity for anybody regardless of age or background to succeed, as long as he is able to come up with something new. There has also been a rise in digital nomads who travel from place to place to work with just their laptop. The use of new media gives them the freedom in doing the things they want. Hence, new media has changed the world economically in terms of how people do business and make a living. New media also empowers ordinary citizens to have a voice and brings about social changes. Social media or blogging sites promote the freedom of expression and ease of accessbility. People can bring about changes through online mediums. For instance, the ASL ice bucket challenge went viral globally and spread awareness about this disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. More than 17 million people posted videos online, including Bill Gates and former US president George W. The local straw-free campaign was also started out online by the then 17-year-old Ang Zyn Yee. On a political scale, social revolutions such as Arab Spring was spurred on by social media as protesters organised protests on sites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Citizens could express their disastisfaction with their governments and be united to create change. The power of new media has also proved effective for raising funds and doing charity to improve society. After the Manchester bombings, the hashtag #roomformanchester trended as locals and hotels opened up their doors to stranded concert goers. Online sites such as www.care.org also alerts people to various crises going around the world and provides the channels for individuals to donate. Social media has thus managed to connect people from all parts of the world and made it easier for one to make a difference in anothers’ life. Social connectivity that transcends geographical boundaries, as well as social alienation, are also products of new media media. It has allowed people to be connected with others from all over the world through various common interests. Young Internet users now have online friends and they bond over shared music taste, political views, etc. New media has also changed the dating scene. Almost half of milennials have used an Internet dating service or app at one point in their life. This has expanded the reach of single’s social networks, facilitating interactions between people who might never have crossed paths otherwise. However, negative impacts on dating might be how it has influenced people to choose partners based on more superficial reasons or the fact that people who meet online may have be too different for a long-lasting relationship. New media also presents the new problem of social alienation due to addiction to the virtual world. People, young and old alike, are glued to their mobile phones. The Guardian revealed that people spend 3 to 4 hours on social media alone. This means one sixth of the day is detached from human reality, isolated from meaningful face to face interactions. Studies have shown that teens who use social media heavily are more likely to feel socially isolated and experience more loneliness. This is due to the lack of personal touch and ability  to form deeper connections with other people. Hence, although people become more wired in the modern world with new age, they are also more alienated and distant from the real world. New media also destabilizes society and poses threats to global and national security. Social media has been known to be a terrorist breeding ground and terrorist organisations such as ISIS frequently use it to recruit vulnerable individuals. These people are typically isolated from society and easily radicalised. There is also the increased fake news on modern forms of media that poses a threat to the stability of a society. For instance, there was a claim by the Leave side in the Brexit that 350 million pounds a week would be taken from the UK’s contribution to the EU’s budget and put into National health service. This piece of information was untrue and unverified but circulated widely due to the fast speed of new media, influencing the beliefs of many voters. There was also the false news of Pope Francis endorsing Trump as a presidential candidate. This was shared a million times on Facebook and shows the great outreach that new media has and its impact of key political outcomes. Much personal data is also being put online for access to firms and governments, but also for criminals and organisations with ill intent. Personal data is often used for commercial interests of large companies. Google and Facebook track users’ interests and online activity to earn money from targeted advertisements. Data can also be bought on where one lives, how much they spend on shopping or even one’s cellphone number. A notable case is the Cambridge Analytica incident where almost 87million facebook user data was collected without their knowledge and used to influence their voter opinion on behalf of the politician who hired Cambrdige Analytica. The misuse of personal data infringes human rights of privacy but most policies in the world have yet to keep up with how new media is changing our lives in this aspect. In conclusion, new media has had drastic impacts on the way we live our lives in both positive and negative ways. There ought to be safeguards such that the social fabric is protected by having certain guidelines and limitations. Gatekeepers should exists such as regulations to new media or education on how to reap the greatest benefits of this new way of life.",How far has new media changed our way of life?
Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2020,A,"Artificial Intelligence has only grown exponentially in its capabilities in the last few years with the rise of self-driving cars, voice recognition softwares that answer to our every trivial question and pressing demand, as well as robots equipped with paint brushes and palettes creating masterpieces resembling that of trained artists. The idea of robots and Artificial Intelligence overtaking Mankind may not actually be merely science fiction with their superior ability to process information, perform challenging tasks at high speed and efficiency, and even innovate. This has incited fears that Artificial intelligence will steal the jobs of many and eventually take over the world. It is easy to dismiss Artificial intelligence as being more problematic than artificial. However, I believe such fears were blown out of proportion. The benefits that Artificial intelligence has brought about in enhancing efficiency of work, solving global issues and enhancing the quality of life greatly outweighs the problems created.  Artificial intelligence has the ability to analyse large amounts of data in a short span of time, thus enhancing efficiency of workforces and creating benefits for corporations in the form of cost savings. A common application of artificial intelligence is chatbots found on websites of many companies. They are used to answer questions by customers and can reduce the job of employees doing customer service as standard queries can be answered by the AI. Using AI and machine learning, systems can test hundreds of mathematical models of production and outcome possibilities. This helps in enhancing precision in their analysis while adapting to new information such as new product introductions, supply chain disruptions or sudden changes in demand. Artificial intelligence is also employed by in reports such as what products are selling fastest and are most popular. Through the analysis of large data, it can confirm the impacts of marketing campaigns on product sales, break down the costs of a new packaging choice or shipping method, and much more. Filing reports manually is a painstaking task, and trying to rush through the process could cause mistakes. The combination of AI with big data analytics brings better forecasts and takes the burdens off the people who prepare the reports. It also helps conquer the inevitability of mistakes. The error margin in machines is very low whilst even the most careful people make blunders often because of mental fatigue. Artificial intelligence has also brought immense benefits to resolving global issues from its abilities to analyse data at a fast speed. For example, AMP Robotics in Colarado and TOMRA are bringing relief to the global issue of plastic waste by employing smart robots for recycling. The robots are equipped with sensors and vision systems fortified with machine learning software. In recycling facilities, they speed up the rate at which incoming items are sorted, identified and then processed. SamurAI, developed by Machinex uses artificial intelligence (AI) to identify objects on a conveyor belt. It can recognize recyclables such as cartons, plastic bottles, and containers. After the robot identifies the object, it uses a suction cup to pick it up and place it into the correct bin. Compared to human workers, SamurAI is more efficient. Manual picking usually involves 35 picks per minute, while this sorting robot can perform up to 70 picks every minute. This helps the firm to contribute more to preserving the Earth and providing innovative as well as environmentally responsible waste and recycling solutions. Other examples of artificial intelligence to resolve this global issue of waste is the Bin-e smart trash can that is equipped with a camera and sensors. It relies on machine learning to detect and identify the waste that has been thrown in it. After it recognizes the object, it will direct the item into the right chamber. When the chambers are full, it will notify the maintenance team to take the trash to the recycling plant. Every time someone throws an item into the bin, its computer system will collect information such as the brand and quantity of items and the data will be automatically uploaded to the cloud. The team at Bin-e believes their innovation could reduce Europe’s waste issue, since out of 213 million tons of waste produced every year in Europe, only 30% is recycled. Hence, it is evident that Artificial intelligence is being employed in innovative ways to solve complex global issues. Artificial intelligence also comes with higher accuracy and precision that can benefit industries requiring them, and bring about improvements to the quality of life. In the healthcare sector, accuracy is especially crucial for surgical techniques or recognising cancerous tissue. Professionals tend to have 20-30% false negatives, and false positive are also common. Artificial intelligence can help to counter this. By leverage on machine-learning algorithms and expose them to more data, hidden patterns can be unearthed to improve the accuracy of medical tests. Merantix, a research lab, currently applies deep learning to detect lymph nodes in human body in CT image. This is cheaper than if done manually and can be applied to real patients to identify to some extent if someone is at risk of carcigonic lymph nodes. In addition, robots with AI are increasingly assisting in microsurgical procedures to reduce surgeon variations that can affect patient recovery. Deepmind is working with National Health Service to ensure doctors and nurses are in the right place at the right time. It identifies patients with urgent needs and have helped to reduce mortality rates. Artificial intelligence also helps in developing new drugs. Pfizer, a leading biopharmaceutical company, uses IBB Watson, a system that has machine learning to power its search for immuno-oncology drugs. Another team from AI pharma startup Insilico Medicine took just 46 days to identify a potential drug with the help of AI. This ushers in an era of quicker, cheaper and more effective drug discoveries, bring in benefits to society. However, the abuse of Artificial Intelligence when it falls into the wrong hands can bring about more problems as it can programmed for disruption of society. AI can pose a security risk to society if programmed for violence and destruction. It can be programmed to kill and can cause mass casualties. It may also not be able to be turned off if humans lose control of the machine’s capabilities. Ethical issues may also arise on who is responsible for the casualties. Currently, Facebook’s newsfeed algorithm is a form of AI and misues personal data of identified individuals to spread propaganda. It can be considered a form of social manipulation and has influenced election outcomes as well as affected geopolitics. This shows how AI can be used by power hungry politicians to further their political agenda through manipulation and deception. On a large scale, the fate of the whole nation will be at stake. A notable example is that of Cambrdige Analytica, British consulting firm that made use of algorithms with AI to harvest data of thousands of Facebooks profiles for Trump’s presidential election in 2016. It learnt their political leanings and had targeted advertisements on their newsfeeds to manipulate their beliefs. This may have swung votes and undermined the democracy of the system. Artificial intelligence is also feared to cause the widespread losses of jobs since seemingly menial tasks can be easily carried out at a much faster speed with AI. This would hit the labour market hard, especially more routine occupations that involve repetitive and thus easily codified tasks. Routine-based tasks in factories or retail stores may be replaced by AI which can recognise, sort and organise items at faster speed. New problems of unemployment or widening income gap may arise with artificial intelligence.  In conclusion, advancements in artificial intelligence will continue to improve and become more integrated with our daily lives. As Stephen Hawking once said, “Artificial Intelligence is likely to either be the best or worst thing to happen to humanity.” I hold firm to the belief that problems created by Artificial Intelligence can be circumvented with proper regulations by government and international bodies. Corporations also have a duty to stop the misuse of this cutting-edge technology. At the same time, we should adapt to the changes that it can bring and embrace the many benefits that it has.",Artificial intelligence creates more problems than benefits. Discuss
Wen Ying,Raffles Institution,2019,A,"As many more countries are beginning to open up their economies to welcome an increased flow of goods and services, people and even ideas, the world is then becoming increasingly interconnected and interdependent. The extent to which this process of globalisation is occurring is so large that some have started to deem the world as borderless. With the increased flow of things in the world, comes many advantages that many closed economies would never once have imagined enjoying. But yet, there is a much darker side to globalisation that would not seem obscure to many. In fact, there is an increasing prevalence of security threats through the flow of humans and goods around the world, resulting in incidents such as the numerous terrorist attacks that one would hear about regularly. However, there are much more impacts from a borderless world than just its increasing security threats. Significant economic benefits can be reaped and with good governance, this problem of security threats can be contained. Therefore, countries should still embrace the notion of a borderless world.  Despite the many advantages of a borderless world, some countries may still prefer not to embrace this borderless world due to the possibility of the increased flow of people posing a security threat to society. These people may have different views on culture and religion from those of the domestic country or even harbour evil intent towards the country. Due to the differing mindsets of these migrants, this brings about possible tensions in society that could undermine the social fabric of the country. For example, due to the influx of migrants that were accepted into Britain, this resulted in the Boston bombings that occurred in 2013 that killed and harmed many., The bombings were initiated by several migrants that wanted to wreck havoc at this major event and bring fear to people’s lives. This thus illustrates the possible evil intentions that people from other countries may harbour to undermine the social fabric of a country. Furthermore, the acceptance of more immigrants into Europe may pose a security threat as well as these immigrants may not adopt similar mindsets to those of the domestic country. The xenophobic sentiments of some in the society also fuel the possibility of this increasing security threat as they begin to alienate these immigrants. As they become more segmented from society, this increases the possibility of these immigrants turning to getting themselves radicalised to give themselves a sense of belonging to a larger community. This is as seen in how there is an increasing trend in how many European ghettos are getting radicalised by the ISIS propaganda, which may potentially result in further tensions or even disastrous events in the future. Therefore, in order to maintain the social fabric and stability in a country, some countries would still prefer to not embrace this notion of a borderless world.  However, countries should still embrace this notion of a borderless world as the increasing security threats are caused by the interconnectedness of countries, making this a global problem and not one that is caused solely by one country. The borderless world then provides the opportunity for other countries to aid in reducing the prevalence of such security threats and not only expect the country experiencing these security threats to deal with the problems themselves. As countries are given the opportunity to work together to solve this problem without borders, countries should embrace this notion well. Taking the example of the global superpower, USA, which has the largest and strongest military in the world. They utilise their military to reduce the security threats posed to the world by sending their troops to Afghanistan, where there is a constantly raging war that poses significant security threats to both the USA itself and the world. In an attempt to settle the war using their global superpower status and strong military, the USA has reduced the security threat that the war in Afghanistan has posed to the world. Without the borderless world, it would have been difficult for the USA to send its troops to Afghanistan and the current security threat could have been much worse than it already is. Therefore, by embracing the notion of a borderless world, countries are more able and willing to send appropriate aid to other countries to reduce the increasing security threats that they pose to the world, making it important for them to do so.  In addition to being able to help in reducing the increasing security threats in the world, the notion of a borderless world should be embraced as the economic benefits significantly outweigh the security problems that may possibly arise. The security problems that may arise can be contained with a good government that allocates resources appropriately and implements the right policies in a country, allowing the country to still reap the economic benefits of a borderless world amidst the increasing security threat. Taking the example of the small and open economy of Singapore, Singapore lacks natural resources and has a relatively small labour force. They thus require foreign manpower to ensure that their economy remains strong, making them open to accepting many foreign workers into the country, This has been very successful as seen in how Singapore is considered to be very successful in economic terms, given their small land area and small population size. As an open economy, Singapore is also susceptible to increasing security threats as a result. This is as seen in how there were several bomb threats aimed at some significant locations in Singapore such as Marina Bay Sands. But with a good government that provided increased security checks and increased awareness of these security threats amongst its citizens through initiatives such as the SGSecure application, Singapore was able to prevent such disastrous events from happening. Thus, as the problem of increasing security threats is manageable with sound policies and allocation of appropriate manpower to ensure stability in a country, countries should embrace this notion of a borderless world to reap its economic benefits.  In conclusion, countries should embrace the notion of a borderless world as it provides opportunities for other countries to help in solving the root cases of the increasing security threats and also the opportunity to reap significant economic benefits from it. The problem of increasing security threats can be solved given a good government with sound implementation of policies. As this is a problem with the potential to be solved, all the more should countries strive to solve this problem and gain from what globalisation initially set out to give the world.","In the light of increasing security threats, should countries still embrace the notion of a borderless world?"
Wen Ying,Raffles Institution,2019,A,"One would associate technology to the prevalence of social media and machines in the workplace today. Regarding health, one would then say that technology is one of the leading causes of many health problems in the world today, especially in the case of obesity. But apart from that, there are many other benefits that technology has brought to the health sector in today’s world. We often overlook these benefits and only focus on the negative impacts that technology has brought upon us. Therefore, technology has brought about more benefits than disadvantages on health in today’s world as there is better accessibility to healthcare, better treatment processes and also an increase in ease of conducting health-related research.  Most would say that technology has brought about negative impacts on health in today’s world. This is due to the prevalent use of technology in our daily lives such as the use of social media and food-delivery services. Technology brings people much convenience as all they are required to do is to tap a few times on their phone screen and they then just need to wait for their messages or commands to be sent over to the other receiving party. Social media sites such as Instagram and Facebook allow for communication between people even if they are not facing each other and food-delivery services such as FoodPanda and GrabFood allow one to wait in the comfort of their own homes for their meals to be delivered to their doorsteps. This then causes many to stay sedentary as they are now not required to move around yet step out of their houses to get things done. Many thus take advantage of the convenience brought about by technology to lead a sedentary lifestyle. As seen in Singapore, obesity rates have been soaring without any sign of slowing down. People are eating more and moving less, which is mainly caused by this sedentary lifestyle that technology has brought upon us. Therefore, it can be said that technology has had a negative impact on out health in today’s world and we are becoming increasingly dependent on technology to complete many of out daily tasks without lifting a finger.  Overlooking the negative impacts that technology has on our health in today’s world, we now focus on the positive impacts. The advancement of technology has increased the accessibility of quality healthcare to many parts of the world which were once deprived of this quality healthcare. Along with globalisation, more healthcare officers are now able to access developing countries to provide treatment for its people and more information regarding treatment can be communicated across geographical boundaries. Telemedicine is one example of how technology has increased accessibility of healthcare to many developing parts of the world. A clinic was set up in Haiti after the Haiti earthquake struck in 2010, hoping to treat patients to the best of their ability. Telemedicine allowed for the healthcare officers and doctors working there to communicate with experts in more developed countries to receive diagnosis and treatment advice, providing better treatment for these victims. Eventually, the clinic treated at least 10 000 patients up to date, showing how efficient telemedicine is in providing these people with much better health. These patients need not travel beyond geographical boundaries to receive proper treatment anymore and are now able to do so within their own countries, illustrating how the increase in accessibility of healthcare brought about by technology has had a positive impact on health in todays world.  Another positive impact that technology has brought on health in today’s world is the better equipment and assistance that a doctor is able to utilise when treating a patient. The increasing usage of robots and machines in the healthcare industry today helps to better monitor the state of health that one is in and also carry out more precise surgeries to target a wider range of problems. One example is that of the usage of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). MRI allows doctors to see into different parts of the brain to diagnose a patient, without having to perform an invasive surgery to do so. MRI has also allowed scientists and doctors to have access to parts of the brain that were never once accessible. Apart from that, more AI-powered robots are used in assisting doctors in diagnosing patients in today’s world. These robots provide the primary diagnosis of the patient and together with the doctor’s own opinion, the doctor then makes the final call. This has then significantly increased the quality of diagnosis and healthcare that doctors and hospitals are able to provide now as the robots are able to cover up for possible minor mistakes that a human doctor could make. AS there is an increase in quality of healthcare provided in today’s world with the advancement of technology, it has thus made a positive impact on health in today’s world.  Finally, as technology advances, scientists and doctors are now able to conduct healthrelated researches with much more ease and with a much higher success rate. Scientists and doctors would have access to more equipment that aids them in their research processes and testing of their hypothesis. Taking the example of in-vitro and in-silico testing, many researchers make use of these two methods in testing out potential drugs or treatments before trying them out on real patients. These testing methods are able to accurately simulate a normal human body’s reactions to their drugs or treatments. Researchers can then modify their methods accordingly to come up with the best and more effective drug or treatment. As the research process becomes easier and more convenient, more novel drugs and treatment processes can be tried and tested to be used in the healthcare industry. With more drugs and treatment processes, doctors can now treat a larger variety of health problems, significantly increasing the quality of health of people. This is illustrated in the example of the spread of mad-cow disease in the past. As much research and tastings were carried out with the advent of technology, the cause of the disease was eventually found out to be prions. Doctors were then able to find a method to prevent the spread of this disease as they now know the cause. Due to the advancement in technology that has brought about convenience and ease in the research process, more novel drugs and treatment processes are carried out on patients now, alleviating the effects of health problems on them. Thus, technology can be said to have a positive impact on health in today’s world.  In conclusion, with benefits of something comes disadvantages and possible unintended consequences. This applies to technology on health as well. It is inevitable that negative impacts would arise due to advancements in technology but if we are able to reduce these negative impacts and recognise the positive ones, it can then be concluded that technology has had a significantly larger positive impact on health in today’s world than a negative one.",How has technology impacted health in today’s world?
Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,N.A.,"Nelson Mandela once said, “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” For a long time, education has been viewed as the key to eliminating gender inequality, to reducing poverty, to creating a sustainable planet, to preventing deaths and illness, and to foster peace. It equips individuals with knowledge and skills to be self-sustaining and independent. It also develops generations of enlightened and socially conscious citizens who work towards achieving success for their nation. However, the structure of formal education has failed to keep up with the rapid changes in technology and advancements in society. This has led  some to question whether education is still a crucial component for a country to thrive. Nevertheless, I believe education is still the key as it imparts important values for social cohesion, inculcates relevant skills for economic progress and empowers people to make positive social change. Detractors may argue that the outdated education system in most countries are ineffective in equipping individuals with the right skills for success. The current education system was designed for the industrial era. Schools have a top-down culture, with a one-size-fits-all curriculum. Cohorts are age-based and students are streamed based on standardised test. The issue with this system is that students are trained to drill context, memorisation and regurgitation of large chunks of information. This can be seen through the extensive syllabus requirements for Cambridge A-levels, as well as lengthy vocabulary lists that students memorise in preparation for SATs. In this digital age, content is less important than context. With an Internet connection, there is a wealth of information right at our fingertips, one click away. It is more important to be able to respond to real life challenges through problem solving skills, analytical skills and inference skills. Little focus is placed on developing these skills and people are left to learn them through their experiences later in life, if they even pick them up. In addition, the emphasis on discipline and rote-memorisation techniques leave little room for innovation. Creativity is stifled as students only hope to attain the “right” answer. Schools in Singapore and East Asian countries are known for their rigorous curriculum and high performing students. These education systems produce students who top the Programme for International Student Assessments (PISA) and Trends in International Math and Science Study (Timss) rankings. However, companies from these countries are barely featured in Forbes’ annual rankings of top countries. This shows that education does not translate to better innovation and better work. The highly regimented education also stifles passion for learning in the students and become passive learners. Instead of being driven and self-directed, they need to be spoon-fed information. Students should instead be taught how to learn. This ineffectiveness of the education system limits its influence on a country’s success. Education is also not inclusive of all abilities and social-economic status so it is no longer the key to a nation’s success. There is a global obsession with grades that not only takes a toll on the mental health of students, but also causes a social divide. In the past, the system in Singapore focused on academic credentials based on merit and allowed access to education for all. The meritocratic system enabled those who worked hard to move up the social ladder. This created social cohesion and a sense of purpose. However, Singapore is no longer that fledgling state. Highly stratified and competitive school system has pushed more advantaged families to provide additional support for their child. This includes extra lessons for English, Maths, Mother Tongue, Science, as well as enrichment classes in the fields of sport, performing arts, visual arts. Those who lack the financial means will struggle to catch up. In the US, upper class preschools exist to cater to children of the wealth and are seen to be the first step towards an Ivy-League education. Education is thus biased towards the wealthy. Nearly half of low income students are concentrated in the same schools while students from top schools mostly come from middle to high income backgrounds. Over time, the divide may continue to widen, especially if education is unable to help those students underperforming. The large student to teacher ratio renders inadequate help for social and emotional issues faced, such as dysfunctional families. Full potential of lower performing students is not reached and the income gap cannot be closed. A fragmented and ununited nation may arise as a result. However, many changes are underway to fix the flaws in the education so that it continues to provide a quality education for all and bring success to the nation. Governments in many developed countries have acknowledged the inequality problem and are actively finding solutions. Singapore launched a new inter agency task force called Uplift, short for Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce, to help disadvantaged homes level up. 30% of places at Education ministry-run kindergartens are also being set aside for children from disadvantaged soio-economic backgrounds. Independent schools in Singapore will also lower the fees for lower income families to have greater diversity. Non-profit organisations are also pulling their weight in reducing the education inequality. The South East Community Development Council’s programme “Lift me, Ah Kor/Ah Jie” offers mentoring programme to lift students up by helping them deal with their home problems so they can better focus in schools.  Schools are also moving with the times and aligning education better with the needs of the 21st Century. Finland provides a prime example of a revolutionised, modernised education system. They have no standardised tests and a more relaxed atmosphere. Formal education is only compulsory at the age of 9 and class sizes are small. Students have the free time to pursue their own independent learning and pursue their other passions. Teachers also know their students well and can provide them with more support. “We prepare children to learn how to learn, not how to take a test,” said Pasi Sahlberg, a former math and physics teacher who is now in Finland’s Ministry of Education and Culture. They aim to develop a child holistically, instead of only in grades. Singapore is also making some small, but significant changes to reduce the emphasis on grades. School-based assessments have been removed for primary 1 and 2 students and reduced for upper primary students. PSLE will not have aggregate score but have a wider scoring band to reduce the stress pupils face in trying to chase that final mark, and give them time to develop their interests. Discretionary admission schemes which admit students into schools based on their aptitude in a particular field will also be expanded in the Institute of Technical Education, polytechnics and universities. The syllabus is also changing to cater to more practical skills, by introducing Science Practical Assessments and learning journeys. Students are also being taught more to apply the information they have learnt. Hence, education is changing to stay relevant and will remain key to developing individuals for the nation’s success. In this highly globalised world, education is also all the more necessary for society to remain harmonious. Globalisation has brought about diversity since people from all over the world are able to meet, whether in real life or virtually. Being global-minded and having collaboration skills are of great importance as they determine the country’s success. Fostering of a more united community is done through community education where students are taught about different groups of people and learn to be accepting of those different from them. Overseas exchange programmes also widen a students’ perspective, enabling them to experience things outside their culture and interact with different people. More than 120 out of the 353 primary and secondary schools in Singapore currently offer such exchange programmes. There is also increasing focus on group work, where it is now a tested requirement in project work. Moral education is also a requirement and students are given conduct grades. With terrorism on the rise, often fuelled by the deep-seeded misunderstanding between various peoples within national boundaries and across international boundaries, education is crucial in fostering mutual respect and understanding between different races and cultures. This would settle differences and prevent conflicts. The interconnected and interdependent world is also evolving at a fast rate and education is needed so that a country can stay relevant and progress economically. Many existing jobs will start to disappear as smart machines and lower cost workers take over. It has been estimated that about half of all jobs in the world are at risk of being automated within 5 years. Education upgrades skills of the people so they do not become obsolete. Singapore has launched the Lifelong Learning Institute to encourage workers to continue learning past formal education to polish their skills or pick up new ones. Vocational training in countries such as Germany and Switzerland are education targeted at the job and have led to decreased unemployment, especially for youths, since skills learnt are relevant and directly applicable to their jobs. Basic education also sets the foundation for more scientific and technological advancements to improve the welfare of society. Many cures or vaccines are being developed such as the HIV vaccine that researchers at the University of PittsburghTrusted Source Technology are developing. As Lee Kuan Yew said, “My definition of an educated man is a man who never stops learning and wants to learn”. The continuous learning mindset will be one that enables society to continue progressing and staying relevant. Lastly, education encourages social activism and advocacy. It is through education that there has been gradual demolition of gender prejudices. Benefits to increasing education for females include improved maternal health, reduced infant mortality and fertility rates to increased prevention against HIV and AIDS. Women learn to enact a limit on procreation and learn family planning. Each extra year of a mother’s schooling reduces the probability of infant mortality by 5-10 per cent. Each additional year of schooling beyond primary also offers greater payoffs for improved opportunities, options and outcomes for girls and women. There will also be greater female labour force participation rates and more productive workforce for the country. Other social injustice still exist such as human trafficking, racial discrimination, honour killings, etc. Education plays an important role in bringing international awareness to these issues. With deeper understanding and insights on them, people in society can devise strategies to deal with them. Education can also allow one to participate in the running of a nation. In a democracy, getting to hear from everyone will benefit the nation. Literacy is necessary in giving individuals the basic right to vote, as well as rough awareness of what is going on. This empowers to oppressed and allow society to progress. In conclusion, as HG Wells puts it, “Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe.” Although there may be some flaws in education systems today, it is still imperative that nations be rid of the greatest enemy of progress- ignorance. Education is a big investment that countries are willing to make due to its continued importance in bringing success to a nation through promoting social cohesion, developing the economy and combating social issues. Education needs to be therefore be improved to keep up with the times and be inclusive.",To what extent is education still the key to a nation’s success.
Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,N.A.,"Borocay, an island in the central Philippines, was known for their pristine beaches and clear water. However, the influx of tourists led to the worsening of sewage problems and deterioration of water conditions. It was closed for six months in 2019 for rehabilitation. Many tourist destinations are facing the same problem. With increasingly cheaper air travel and affluent middle class, travelling has become widely accessible. The number of international travellers a year has increased from 500 million to over a billion in this decade and is estimated to hit 1.4 billion by 2020. Tourism’s negative impacts include, and are not limited to, contributing to climate change, depletion of natural resources and degradation of natural habitats. However, government regulations and the rise of eco-tourism are mitigating these negative impacts. Tourism has had negative impacts in climate change due to the large amounts of carbon pollution from aviation. Unregulated carbon pollution is the fastest-growing source of greenhouse gases and will only worsen as demand for air travel. One study estimated that a single transatlantic return flight emits almost half the CO2 emissions produced by all other sources (lighting, heating, car use, etc.) consumed by an average person yearly. Tour buses also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, especially when they leave the engine running for long periods of time so that tourists can return to an air-conditioned bus. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere and thus increase the global temperature. Furthermore, growth of  countries due to globalisation also led to its urbanisation. Great hectares of forests are lost through deforestation. Mass tourism has heightened pressures on forests in Turkey. Cambodia has lost 1.6 million hectares of forest between 2001 and 2014. With fewer trees, less carbon dioxide is absorbed. The increase in greenhouse gases is the primary for rising sea levels, freak weather events globally and the loss of habitats.  However, governments have realised this problem and are taking action against it. France is planning to introduce and eco-tax for all flights from French airports. Revenue from the tax will be invested in non-polluting forms of air travel. Several airlines are also beginning to test biofuels, which can be the replacement source of fuel in the future. There are also stricter regulations by governments on deforestation. In 2017, the clearing of forests in Borneo reached its lowest since 2003. Tourism has also had negative impacts on the environment due to strain on infrastructure. With more tourists, development of facilities such as accommodation, water supplies, restaurants and entertainment facilities are required. Such construction activity involves sand mining, beach and sand dune erosion, soil erosion and extensive paving. In Yosemite National Park, the number of roads and facilities have been increased to keep pace with the growing visitor numbers and to supply amenities, infrastructure and parking lots for all these tourists. These actions have caused habitat loss in the park and are accompanied by various forms of pollution including air pollution from automobile emissions. Smog produced is harmful to all species and vegetation in the park. The popularity of Angkor Wat in Cambodia led to the development of nearby areas. Large volumes of water was being used to cater to tourists needs leading to shortage of groundwater that threatened the collapse of monuments. Since Myanmar opened up to tourism in 2010, its number of visitors grew 28% to hit 3.44 million in 2017. This has, however, endangered its fragile ecosystem as too many hotels have sprung up to accommodate the visitors. The situation got so severe that even water rationing exercises had to be carried out. What makes things worse is building of entertainment facilities such as golf courses and ski resorts. Golf courses are notorious for being a resource-intensive project. An average golf course in a tropical country would require around 150kg of chemicals, fertilisers, pesticides, herbicides, and as much water as what 6000 rural villagers use.  Construction of ski resorts require clearing large pieces of land artificially and altering the landscape to allow for certain level ski runs. Trees are removed and terrain grading changed. Ponds and rivers may be tapped for water to generate artificial snow.  Modern snowmaking equipment can easily require 100 gallons of water per minute for each snow gun, and resorts can have dozens or even hundreds in operation. At Wachusett Mountain Ski Area, a modest-size resort in Massachusetts, snowmaking can pull as much as 4,200 gallons of water a minute.  Tourists’ activity also directly impact the environment negatively. Waste disposal and sewage management has become a big problem. For instance, Mount Everest has been turned from a natural wonder to the “world’s highest garbage dump”. The colour of the snow has turned a darker colour and Sherpas reveal over 5000kg of trash have been left there. Cruise ships in the Carribean are estimated to produce over 70000 tons of waste annually. Sewage pollution has also increased, affecting many places from Maya Bay in Thailand to Santorini in Greece, causing the loss of balance in aquatic systems. Coral reefs are in danger because of their vulnerability to polluted waters, as well as marine activities. Tourist activities occur around these fragile ecosystems. Collection of corals, shells, and other marine souvenirs, either by individual tourists or local people, who then sell them as souvenirs to tourists, has a detrimental effect on the local environment. Anchoring, snorkeling, sport fishing and scuba diving, yachting, and cruising are some of the activities that can cause direct degradation of marine ecosystems such as coral reefs, and subsequent impacts on coastal protection and fisheries. It was discovered that most of the corals at Maya Bay have been damaged by boat anchors and the overall coral damage has reached critical levels. 93% of the reefs in Costa Rica are also in danger due to tourism.  However, all is not lost as more countries are beginning to put regulations on the number of visitors allowed and promoting environmental conservation. This lessens the overtourism in certain areas and mitigate those negative impacts on infrastructure and natural habitats. Santorini has started limiting the number of visitors by cruise ships to 8000 per day. During its peak season, over 10000 tourists arrive every day, putting significant strain on local resources. The Italian government also announced a limit of 1.5 million visitors per year to their picturesque villages in the mountain side, known as Cinque Terre.  Many tourist attractions are also closing for rehabilitation work. Indonesia’s Komodo National Park is announced to be closed temporarily for habitat restoration. This is to improve the current system of monitoring and controlling visitors over the area so that the Komodo dragon’s habitat will be well-maintained. Maya Bay will also be closed to tourists for two years for the coral rehabilitation efforts. More than 23000 new corals have been planted since its closure. The authorities are also planning to cap the number of visitors at 2000 per day, down from over 4000 tourists in the past. These show the increased action taken by governments to mitigate the negative impacts of tourism on the environment. Individuals are also, on their own, becoming more aware of the issue and adopting eco-tourism. Eco-tourism is a sustainable form of travelling and involves travelling to areas that conserve the environment. It is growing 10-15% annually worldwide and is one of the fastest growing sectors in tourism. A famous advocate for environmental issues and eco-tourism is actor Leonardo DiCaprio who plans to build an eco-resort on Belizean private island of Blackadore Caye. Blackadore Caye has suffered from overfishing, an eroding coastline and deforestation of its mangrove trees for years but this eco resort aims to be energy efficient and restore the island. Zip-line canopy tours in Panama Thailand and Costa Rica, for example, also provide opportunities for responsible travellers to observe the flora and fauna of rainforests beneath them without leaving any carbon footprint. Resorts are also adopting green practices to cater to the tourists who have become more environmentally-friendly. Vail Resorts, is embracing wind power to run lifts, restaurants and hotels. Smuggler’s Notch in Vermont has initiatives that include wildlife and habitat protection, energy efficiency, recycling, and water conservation. Many places also educate people about fuel waste through idling and give tours of the wastewater treatment facility.   In conclusion, tourism has had negative impacts on our environment due to the greenhouse gases, infrastructure strain and human activities. However, more people are becoming more aware and adopting green practices. Governments are also imposing more regulations. This mitigates negative impacts of tourists. Travel is ultimately to broaden our minds and for our leisure. It should not need to come at the expense of our environment.",To what extent has tourism has tourism had a negative impact on the environment.
Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,N.A.,"“Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants.” This quote by Omar Bradley highlights the scientific and technological advancements that mankind has made in the past century. Scientific discoveries have shed light on our physical world, pushing the boundaries of knowledge. This has given way to cutting edge technology that revolutionised the way humans think and act. However, the immense power of such developments and the pace of breakthroughs have raised ethical and security concerns, resulting in the setting up of regulations in the form of ethics committees, legislation or international agreements. Such regulations can be justified if they benefit the individual and society through serving as a moral compass, prevent harmful creations and exploitation by profit-driven firms. However, some may argue that regulations will impede progress and hinder benefits brought to society by scientific and technological developments. The nature of some kinds of research has improved lives and alleviated global problems. For instance, stem cell research can provide an understanding of how diseases develop and allow invention of new cures. In regenerative medicine, stem cells can also be used to replace diseased cells or grow into tissue. This can save millions of lives amongst those who suffer spinal cord injuries, type 1 diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, stroke, burns, cancer and osteoarthritis. However, the Bush administration stopped federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, which meant US-based institutes reliant on federal funding had to put the brakes on further development in this area. The Vatican has also called for a ban on embryonic stem cell research. This prevents the field from advancing and limits the potential benefits to society. Genetic engineering is also another field with a multitude of possibilities to improve society. It can doctor out genetic diseases such as Huntington’s Disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s, Tay Sachs, Alzheimer’s and epilepsy. What was once thought to be science-fiction such as growing a new limb or altering genes to make “designer babies” could be possible. Genetic modifications to food can also improve its quality and quantity, making it more productive, more disease resistant and nutritional. The Golden rice being used in many countries is seen as the solution for Vitamin A deficiency among the poor. Regulations on genetic engineering is more prevalent for humans than plants or animals. There is broad agreement among many scientists, ethicists, policymakers, and the public that germline editing is a red line that should not be crossed. Using germline editing for reproduction is prohibited by law in more than 40 countries and by a binding international treaty of the Council of Europe. In all other areas of scientific advancements, regulations lengthen the time taken for the process or may even put them to a halt. Unduly restricting clinical trials and medical experimentation would slow down the development of drugs which could provide important cures to illnesses. This is particularly acute during the onset of viral epidemics which pose a threat to human life. Development of a cure for ebola fast tracked on an unprecedented scale. If hampered by undue regulations, slower progress, clinical trials take place over years instead of weeks or months, more deaths in the interim …. This stifling of creativity and innovation would thus would prevent mankind from benefiting from scientific and technological developments. Although advancements in the fields of science and technology can bring benefits to society, it can cause more important ethical considerations to take a backseat. Regulations are justified as they serve as a moral compass to ensure the pursuit of scientific research is for the benefit of society. Scientists continue to push these ethical boundaries resulting in ethical dilemmas. The discovery of the genetic code and improvements in CRISPR technology have allowed for genetic mutations to be detected at an early stage and corrected. Parents may even go as far as to choose what kind of traits they want in the child and incorporate such genes into them. One can foresee the creation of a superior GM human race. This raises ethical questions as to how far humans should be allowed to modify nature and “play God”. Genetic engineering can be seen as unnatural and unnecessary since people believe that humans should just let God or natural evolution take charge. Humans do not have sufficient knowledge on what constitutes good traits for a human being and the human race. Regulations can be justified by preventing the ethical boundaries from being crossed. Regulations also serve as moral guide for scientists in their pursuit of new discoveries. Animal testing, most commonly but not limited to fruit flies and mice, is widely used in scientific research. They are studied to better help scientists understand the human biology and also to develop new medicine and technology. Antibiotics, vaccines, insulin, organ transplantation and HIV treatment have only been developed with the help of experiments involving animals. Animal rights activists argue that it is unethical for animals to be subjected to scientific testing because their quality of living is reduced. The Animal Welfare Act or Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) are some examples of regulations that review proposed animal experiments. Scientists need to provide justification for using animals, procedures or drugs to be used to eliminate or minimize pain and discomfort, and methods to ensure that the experiment does not unnecessarily duplicate previous research harming animals for their research to be approved. This ensures that they still keep the animals welfare in mind and not blindly pursue their research.  Regulations are also justified to protect society from the potential harmful creations of technology from scientific breakthroughs. Some scientific developments have been deemed unsafe and unethical, especially if put in the hands of the wrong people. Artificial intelligence is growing at an accelerated pace. Notable individuals, such as Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Bill Gates, have expressed their concern in its growing potential for harm. One fear is that AI enables government to produce autonomous weapons that can choose their targets, killing innocent civilians. AI weapons would be harder to control than normal ones. AI can also be capable of social manipulation by spreading propaganda to individuals identified through algorithms and personal data. The case of Cambridge Analytica using the data from 50 million Facebook users to try to sway the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the U.K.’s Brexit referendum illustrates the power of AI. AI generated videos, Deepfakes, are also prevalent and have gone viral. If this technology is put in the wrong hands to manipulate and deceive, reputations can be easily destroyed and society’s fabric will be threatened. Currently, global bodies to protect humanity from the potential dangers of AI and machine learning are conspicuously absent but employees at technological companies circulate petitions on the ethics of their products. Regulations would slow down the development of AI and give time for necessary precautions to be taken that can protect society from its potential negative consequences. Other such technology and scientific research with potential harm to society have also been halted. For instance, in the United States, distribution of 3D printed gun blueprints have been banned. A research involving investigating the spread of H7N9 virus in a lab has also been halted for fear of lab accidents that could release the virus to the public or bio terrorists accessing such findings and creating mayhem. Federal regulations on drone usage also exists, such as these unmanned vehicles are prohibited from flying over federal facilities or near airports. They are ultimately to protect the public and can be justified. Regulations also prevent the profit-driven firms from exploiting scientific and technological advancements at the expense of society’s welfare. In 2010, the World Health Organisation warned of the endemic problem of corruption in the business of pharmaceutical companies. Clinical trials may be conducted without proper regulatory approval. Drugs may be produced through substandard or counterfier methods, producing substandard or even harmful drugs. These corrupt practices were driven by monetary benefits and disregard the individual’s welfare. It leads to patient suffering and have severe life or death consequences. Stricter checking of the processes and products will bring benefits by preventing such occurences. Pharmaceutical firms also price their drugs at an exorbitant price, making them inaccessible for those who need them. Gilead Sciences, the American pharmaceutical giant behind the hepatitis C cure, Solvadi, boasted a 45 percent net profit giant, while four million people died of this curable disease. Monsanto, an agricultural company also extracted huge profits from farmers cultivating cash crops like Bt cotton. The seeds were genetically engineered for one time use and have compelled farmers to spend beyond their means and caused severe economic distress. This drove about 270000 farmers to suicide in the nineties. These new technologies thus do not benefit society because of its use for the ruthless pursuit of economic gain. Regulations on their distribution and pricing can ensure the advancements serve those in need. In conclusion, a quote by Omar Bradley on scientific knowledge goes, “To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven, the same key opens the gates to hell.” Scientific knowledge and new technology give us greater ability to do things that we could only have dreamt of before. They can resolve global problems and improve the standard of living, but at the same time cause mass destruction or further fracturing of society. Different stakeholders such as scientists, businesses, government and the public will have different views on what course of action towards new-age technology is right. The ultimate decision should come from wanting the best for the society.",To what extent can the regulation of scientific or technological developments be justified.
Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,N.A.,"The Ebola epidemic ravaging large parts of West Africa is the largest and most severe epidemic of this virus in decades. It has entered large cities and urban slums, resulting in the unprecedented number of cases and deaths. These negative consequences have translated into more misery and hardship for populations that are already deeply impoverished and have been further severely traumatized by the outbreak. The virus also spread to surrounding countries such as the United States and Spain, alarming the global population. The fragility of health systems in our highly globalised world cannot be understated because even with advanced medical technologies, the global health threat remains a pressing issue. Governments are actively improving health institutes and other initiatives to improve health both within their country and globally. It is the most serious problem facing the world today because of the higher speed of disease spreading a globalised world, large world population still living in extreme conditions and the fact that nobody is spared from health problems. The global health threat is the most serious problem because of the high speed at which diseases can spread to cause pandemics in our globalised world. Global disease outbreaks pose a serious problem because of the increased interconnectivity. Pathogens can spread very quickly as the human population increases. With increased air travel and interaction with people all around the world, a pathogen has the potential to wipe out a large percentage of the global population. A recent example of pandemic is the H1N1 influenza in 2009, responsible for more than 17,000 deaths worldwide. The HIV pandemic also affected approximately 36.9 million people globally in 2018 and claimed millions of lives. The severity of pandemics as a global health threat led to projects such as Predict, which aims to fully catalogue all viral threats, and predict which are likely to cause tomorrow’s outbreaks.  The Global Virome Project is even more ambitious and aims to find and sequence almost all the viruses in birds and mammals that could potentially spill over into humans. However, with over half a million viruses still existing and undiscovered, there is a high cost of predicting the arrival of such viruses and also many complexities in getting an accurate prediction. The World Health Organization (WHO) urges countries to develop and implement national pandemic preparedness plans to mitigate the health and social effects of a pandemic. For now, this threat remains imminent and makes global health a serious problem. Furthermore, a large population of the world are living in extreme conditions with poor healthcare and sanitation, making them especially vulnerable to diseases and illnesses. Despite the relentless progress in the field of medicine, global health remains a serious problem due to these inequalities. In a number of African countries south of the Sahara, life expectancy is less than 40 years, half the average lifespan in rich and developed countries of around 80 years. People in developing countries face harsh realities of sexually transmitted diseases, high child mortality rate and malnutrition. With weak health services, they are left without access to healthcare and treatment. For instance, Africa is the region most affected by HIV, with 25 of the 34 million infected living there. However, only 0.001% are able to receive drugs that help improve their lives. Even the rich are not spared from health issues. Global health threat remains the most serious problem facing the world because it affects everyone. The increased affluence in developed countries has led to a rise in the “rich man’s diseases”. These include non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, heart diseases, that account for over 70% of deaths worldwide. 15 million people die prematurely from them. This is attributed to their lifestyles of increasing oily food and being more sedentary. It is easily preventable but education efforts to reduce obesity and diabetes have still largely been ineffective. However, some may argue that the global health threat is no longer the most serious problem facing the world because of new technological advancements to improve global health. Diseases have been eradicated, such as smallpox and rinderpes. Anti-retroviral therapy has also helped in prolonging the lifespan of those with HIV, allowing them to continue leading a normal life. Vaccines are also widely available to increase herd immunity and prevent the spread of pathogens. However, these advancements are not always effective because of the constantly adapting nature of pathogens that render cures ineffective. For instance, antibiotic resistance has become a greater problem due to the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. Around 600000 cases of Tuberculosis were found to be resistant to Rifampicin, currently the most effective first line drug. In addition, in many societies today there is greater resistance to vaccines due to false information about its negative side effects. News reports propagated the fake news that use of vaccines causes autism, preventing parents from giving their child the vaccine. There has now been a rise in measles cases in the US, when this disease was once thought to be eradicated. In conclusion, the global health threat is the most serious problem facing the world today. Despite the many other problems, this affects every person in the world, causes great destruction through the highly interconnected nature of our globalised world, and is not easily solved. It is no wonder that large amounts of money, resources, and talent are put into ensuring the world we live in is healthier and better.",The global health threat is the most serious problem facing the world today.

Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,N.A.,"In 2013, Google announced the creation of the California life company, Calico, which aims to reverse engineer the biology that controls life span. It is looking into age-defying drugs and genetic engineering to enable people to lead longer and healthier lifestyles.  The rise in global average life expectancy, now approaching 70 years, can largely be attributed to advancements in medical research. It has developed cures and vaccines for myriads of once deemed “untreatable” diseases. However, the use of costly medical research, such as those undertaken by Google, to add extra years to the lives of people in developing countries, may seem frivolous and be deemed unjustified. Medical science should not always seek to prolong lives due to the compromises made on quality of life, the greater emphasis needed on improving other aspects of society and the ethical concerns with artificially prolonging life. Medical science should not always seek to prolong life as it compromises on one’s quality of life. The increased longevity in societies is not necessarily indicative of good health. In reality, most age groups live longer with a disability or other health problems. For instance, chronic kidney disease affects more than one in seven adults. Patients with kidney failure need to undergo dialysis regularly, making them unable to maintain their regular standard of living and continue with their normal activities, causing hopelessness and despair. Alzheimer’s is another age-related disease that affects over 5.8 million Americans. This degenerative brain disorder severely affects quality of life as patients as it gradually causes a decline in memory, behavior, and mental capabilities. In addition, there is a difference between the desirability of being alive within the limits of average life expectancy and attempting to live beyond those limits.   Many treatments for serious or chronic illnesses cause more negative side effects to the patient and should not be carried out there is no quality to living. Chemotherapy also causes severe consequences of organ failure, depressed immune system or GI bleeding. Going through these treatments may not eventually guarantee success and their survival. The use of life support machines such as pacemakers, defibrillators and ventilators also lead to unnecessary pain. Patients in the Intensive Care Unit are incapacitated for long periods of time to medical purgatory and are in constant discomfort. In such cases, the patients may feel trapped in an inexorable treadmill of painful efforts to postpone the moment of inevitable death. Life becomes sanctioned torture and loses its meaning. It would be immoral to continue the use of medicine to extend their lives, hence medical science should not always seek to prolong life. Medical science should be aligned with other objectives instead of prolonging life so as to better serve humanity and resolve global issues, such as poverty and famine. In seeking to prolong life, researchers develop  high-priced technology that will be inaccessible by the majority. Only certain segments of the population can benefit from them and live longer. This widens the rich-poor divide and is a waste of resources. Medical science should prioritise the problems troubling the poor, and divert talent and resources away from more frivolous and dispensable pursuits, such as that of longevity.  For instance, hedge fund manager Joon Yun has launched a 1 million dollar prize challenge called the Palo Alto Longevity Prize that challenges scientists to find ways to achieve vitality and longevity. He believes it is possible to hack the code of life and push human lifespan past its maximum. However, this sum of money can be better spent to even out the inequality in today’s world. In a number of African countries south of the Sahara, life expectancy is less than 40 years. This is nearly half the average lifespan in rich and developed countries of 70–80 years. An estimated 800 million people live below the poverty line and face daily struggles of poor nutrition, sanitation and health services. They are susceptible to a plethora of medical problems caused by malnutrition and spread of infectious diseases in their extreme living conditions. Medical science should therefore aim to raise everyone’s lifespan by focusing on ways to improve health care, deliver life saving drugs or surgeries to the poor and not always seek to prolong life. Medical science should also not always seek to prolong life because of the ethics concerning extending life past the natural human limits. The use of respirators, heart assist devices and other aids in hospitals or other institutions have made it possible to keep a patient alive even after the failure of vital organs that would ordinarily result in death. This new ability to postpone death complicates physician’s responsibility and blurred the vital distinctions between natural death, euthanasia and suicide.Conflict may also arise between the health-care professionals as their decisions are contested by patients and families. The situation can look hopeless to the patient and family but the doctors see room for hope for alleviating the condition or bring about cure. However, doctors also know it is difficult to predict when a patient’s death can occur. Courts have usually ruled in favour of the rational patient’s right to decide on discontinuing such special treatment. In addition, new technology further enhances the humans ability to “play God”. For instance, the Human longevity Inc plans to create a database of 1 million human genome sequences including those of supercentenarians. This aims to shed light on what makes for a longer, healthier life and may lead to future developments in genetic engineering to prolong life. Calico has also recruited Cynthia Kenyon, a scientist acclaimed for work that included genetically engineering roundworms to live up to 6 times longer than normal. It may lead to unforeseen negative consequences because of the complexities of the human genome and insufficient knowledge on them. Other technologies such as 3d bioprinting of organs or use of stem cells to replace organs are also laden with ethical concerns as to how far science can go to alter and enhance humans. To prevent such ethical boundaries from being crossed, medical science should not always seek to prolong life.  However, some may say that the original purpose of inventing and researching medicine is to cure people of disease to live a longer and fuller life. Medical science should therefore seek to increase lifespan, together with healthspan. The Hippocratic Oath swears that treatments will be used for the benefit of the ill and not for harm. This sworn agreement serves as a guiding principle for physicians to seek to prolong life. Our lives and society are troubled by the growing number of loved ones lost to age-related diseases and suffering extensive periods of decrepitude. Medical science can make the latter years vibrant by focusing both on living longer and living better with improved treatment of age-related diseases. Developments are already being seen. Clinical trials by Novartis tested an anti-ageing drug in healthy elderly women for Australia and New Zealand that also enhanced their immunity. There can be more research into Alzhemier’s disease that accounts for large number of deaths of people over age 65. This can extend both lifespans, and improve the quality of life of people in society. “The more life is experienced as meaningful, the less we are aware of time.” This quote from a paper by Pijnenburg and Leget highlights how humans do not actually seek more time to live but seek meaningful experiences. The main focus of medical science should therefore not be to prolong life but to ensure everyone, regardless of socioeconomic class, is able to live life to the fullest and have a meaningful life.",Should medical science always seek to prolong life?
Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,N.A.,"Bill Gates once said, “We are changing the world with technology”. Technology brings about endless possibilities from driverless cars to designer babies. Scientists are developing drugs that eradicate diseases, saving millions of lives. Startups are inventing new apps that are transforming traditional business structures. Technology is promising to be a solution for all problems including global poverty, affecting more than 3 million people in the world. Many people in countries such as India, Bangladesh, Niger, Liberia are trapped in vicious poverty cycles which begins when one is born into a poor family and deprived of opportunities. Technology presents a way out by delivering opportunities for livelihood and education, as well as solving problems of healthcare and sanitation that commonly plague the poor. However, technology has its limitations of not being accessible by all and being exploited by companies. Technology creates new jobs and increases the income of people, offering a way out of poverty. One such way is by improved agricultural technology. Most of the 1.4 billion people in poverty and living under USD1.25 a day rely on agriculture for their livelihood. Precision agriculture is changing the way farmers manage their crops and is being adopted at a growing rate. Farmers have access to high-quality inputs, data about crop health and yield, and crucial weather information. This allowed efficient use of resources and increased yield by up to 70%. It has successfully decreased the percentage of people living on less than $1.9 a day from 53.2% to 34.6% from 2006 to 2013. Biotechnology is also a solution to enhance the quality of produce with disease free and nutritionally enhanced varieties of crops. This has enabled India’s many rural farmers to optimise their available resources and ensure farmer’s economic well-being despite climate change threatening crop production. Over 90% of India’s cotton growing area is under BT cotton, a genetically modified crop with higher yields and reduced pesticide use. It has doubled incomes of cotton farmers and improved food security for those in poverty stricken countries.  Furthermore, technology provides communication platforms to connect those in poverty to the larger economy. Whatsapp messages reach out to farmers in India, educating them on better harvesting methods and connecting them to national and international markets. They become micro-entrepreneurs and can build agribusinesses to drive crop growth. In China, rural producers are also using Wechat and other ecommerce platforms to sell goods beyond their original distribution areas, earning more income. Fishermen in the Indian state of Kerala can communicate better with customers using mobile phones and this, on average, increased their profits by up to 8%. The connectivity that technology brings about also gave rise to the Gig economy. Its rise increased employed people and provided opportunities to earn an income. Over 70% of firms in India uses Gig workers. Go-Jek has increased income of Indonesia’s drivers by an average of 44%. Technology will continue to spur innovation and create more jobs for more people to fill. Technology also improves healthcare and sanitation in poverty-stricken countries. They are serious problems in these countries. Over 784 million people in the world have no access to clean water and an average of 1400 people die of diarrhea caused by drinking unclean water. Technology has provided a solution with solar-powered water pumps. It is used in India to use locally sourced equipment to pump 3000 litres of clean and safe water to villagers everyday. A water filter known as the “tea bag” also stands out as a promising solution as it costs less than half of one cent to produce one “tea bag” and it can withstand multiple uses. It purifies up to 1 litre of water and the South African Bureau of Standards has completed its testing and deemed it safe and effective.The World Health Organisations estimates that around 2 billion people have gained access to safe drinkable water since 1990. Those living in rural areas also have less access to healthcare, such as medical equipment and professionals. In disease prevention, technology can be used to spread the word. The residents can gain information about prevention and symptoms of common diseases, improving their standard of living. The Ghanaian project targets pregnant women and delivers weekly automated messages about healthy fetal development. This has made real differences in the health of both mother and baby. Applications are also now available to provide diagnostics and even treatment. 34 villages in the Henan province benefited from an all-in-one diagnostic station. This application runs eleven kinds of tests and uploads the results to a data system for online consultation. Villagers no longer need to travel long distances just to see a doctor and receive medical treatment. Other examples are Shimba Technologies and Eye Netra. Shima Technologies in Kenya can check symptoms, provide first aid information and alert doctors if necessary. Eye netra can diagnose near and far-sightedness, as well as astigmation. It prescribes corrective lenses and saves people  trips to the doctors. Scientists are also researching cures to fight diseases that commonly affect those in poverty regions. A vaccine is being developed to fight a strain of Pneumococcus bacteria, which causes pneumonia and meningitis, prevalent in poor countries. Five western countries and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have pledge $1.5 billion to the developing, manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine. 156 million doses have been distributed in 2017 and its efforts are projected to save 635000 lives. Technology is also providing education access to many in poverty. Education is often hailed as the universal leveller. It equips people with skills that allow them to break out of the poverty cycle. Previously, people in rural areas faced difficulty in getting access to quality education due to untrained teachers and limited resources. Digital classrooms are the new technology that solves this problem. Solar-powered computers and projectors are allowing students to participate in real life interactive lessons with quality teachers. A tech start-up from Shenzhen providing this digital classroom says it has grown to 300000 students in just on year. VIPKid, another company, launched Rural Education programme in 2017 to bring online education to 10000 classrooms by live streaming. Making Ghanaian Girls Great is also another project that uses new technology to provide young girls in Ghana access to education impossible in the past. The Post estimates that 55 million rural students across China will have access to education. 171 million people could be lifted out of poverty if all children left school with basic reading skills. However, greedy corporations may exploit technology to their ruthless pursuit of economic gain instead of to solve poverty. Monsanta extracted huge profits from agriculture in recent years via royalties while farmers cultivating cash crops like Bt cotton have been compelled to spend beyond their means to purchase seeds and chemical inputs. This caused severe economic distress and drove about 27000 farmers to siucide since the mid to late nineties. Technology has not been put to use and worsened the problem of global poverty. In addition, the Gig economy is also largely based on exploitation and has not actually helped in alleviating poverty. For instance, ride-sharing companies such as Uber can avoid paying certain taxes, benefits, overtime, or minimum wages to their drivers by classifying them as independent contractors instead of employees. The firms also incorporate psychological tricks into their apps, like those used by video game designers, to keep their drivers on the road longer. A study by Public Region Research Institute showed  that about half of Californians working in the gig economy are struggling with poverty.  There is also unequal access to technology, limiting its effectiveness as a solution to global poverty. Desite mobile phones reaching an astonishing three-quarters of the world, for some living in poverty, e.g. Tasmania, it could cost them at least two months of their salary. In Guinea-Bissau, people are also paying a staggering sum of $81 for just 500MB of data. Technology is unable to alleviate poverty if acquiring this technology pushes people into it. Poorer countries also lack the technology and information of developed countries. This digital divide only makes it harder for them to catch up, and worsens the gap between the rich and the poor. In conclusion, technology is a useful tool that mankind can use to improve the plight of the poor. It has much potential to be a solution to global poverty. However, governments should work at developing a partnership between developed and developing nations to provide the poor access to the benefits that these technologies bring and thus alleviate poverty.",Is technology the solution to the problem of global poverty?
Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,N.A.,"With news of Koalas being functionally extinct, the disappearance of Iceland’s glacier “Ok”, as well as the lungs of the Earth, the “Amazon Rainforest”, being burned to ashes, resolving climate change seems to be an unattainable goal that we are drifting further and further away from. In today’s world, strong consumerism culture dominates. People buy and throw away their old things with little remorse. Technology and the pursuit of economic gains by the giants of the world paints a bleak picture in the quest to resolve climate change as the burning of fossil fuels are one of its largest contributors. However, I still strongly believe that though resolving climate change may be a Herculean task, it is not impossible with the commitment of government, efforts by eco-conscious firms, the changing mindsets of individuals and the development of new green technology.  Detractors may argue that given the rising populism and conflicting nature of preserving the environment and pursuing economic interests, climate change will not be resolved as governments will not be giving this issue priority. However, governments have a large role to play in setting the regulations for the country in terms of carbon emissions, fossil fuel waste and banning of illegal practices. Brazil’s president, Mr Bolsonaro, instead of pursuing environmentally friendly practices have turned a blind eye to the illegal deforestation and mining in the country as it will bring about economic gains. Such activities have become more frequent since he came into power. in addition, he has rejected help from the G7 nations to stop the fires in the Amazon rainforest. Mr Bolsonaro is backed by the US president, Donald Trump, who responded to the rainforest burning by expressing interest for future, greater, financial partnership with Brazil. This shows the leaders have little concern for the environmental impacts of the rainforest burning and only care about the economic prospects it brings. In addition, Donald Trump has consistent rejected climate change science in favour of his “American First Policy”. Pulling out of the Paris Agreement and removing other regulations previously set in place to prevent climate change has posed a big challenge to the world in tackling this issue as America is seeing the highest levels of carbon emissions lately. This thus poses a big problem to resolving climate change. However, all is not lost due to strong international co-operations and other governing bodies that have remained committed to solving climate change. The European Union is leading this fight against climate change, especially the French and German governments. They have expressed utmost horror at the Amazon Rainforest burning and are committing billions of dollars to its restoration and preservation. They are also using their power to hold other countries accountable for their actions such as the French president threatening to end a trade deal with Brazil if they do not make attempts to solve the problem. In addition, despite America pulling out, the Paris Agreement can be said to be a success as over 196 countries are still committed to doing their part. Singapore has pledged to resolve carbon emissions by 30% before 2030. Even developing countries like China and India are expressing their commitment and have come up with plans to solve climate change. With the efforts of governments all over the world, it is likely that the problem of climate change can be solved. Furthermore, the growing market for eco-friendly goods by enlightened consumers have also pushed firms to take steps towards sustainable practices and move towards resolving climate change. Consumers are becoming more educated, either through schools, the Internet, news reports, or other outlets. They are starting to see the real impacts of climate change in the freak weather events, as well as worsening pollution all around the globe. Firms that have engaged in unethical behaviours are readily exposed and have their reputations destroyed. Consumers are quick to share and boycott such brands. For instance, Nestle committed heinous crimes in Ogoniland, resulting in public outcry when the matter was exposed. Volkswagen’s scheme of setting up devices that tricked the carbon emissions test also eroded the faith of its once loyal customers. In a bid to cater to market demand, as well as do their part for the environment, many companies are announcing their new alignment of aims towards being eco-friendly. In terms of sustainable sources, L’Oreal has pledged to only source from ethical and sustainable suppliers. Many high-end fashion labels like Chanel have also stopped using animal fur. KFC, RWS and many other food and beverages companies have decided to stop giving out straws or single use plastics. As over 100 companies account for 70% of the world’s carbon emissions, their commitment to reduce emissions are imperative to resolving the issue of climate change. Many companies are shifting to use clean energy, as incentivised by government grants or high carbon taxes. They also install devices that can convert the negative pollutants to cleaner forms of air and reduce the impact of the environment. The changing mindsets of individuals on climate change today also make eradicating this issue a realistic aim. Not only are individuals more aware of the severity of the issue, they are also spurred on by activists and inspired to make a difference in their own ways. Greta Thunberg, a 15 year old activities has inspired the fight against climate change. She started “Fridays for Future” by going on strike instead of going to school and managed to get thousands of school children to join her. Her journey across the Atlantic in a boat for 15 days have raised awareness on the impacts of air travel on the environment. She has been giving talks at world conferences and addressing politicians to “Listen to the science” and do their part for climate change. Greta Thunberg has truly served as an inspiration, showing the world that anyone no matter how small can make a difference. Another environmental activist is Leonardo Dicarprio, Oscar-winning actor. He is an ambassador for tackling climate change and advocates strongly for it. His Instagram page has even started to resemble a news site, feed information about climate change to his followers. In recent years, we have seen a rise in an individual’s behaviour to do their part. The metal straw movement, initially brushed across as a “teenage trend”, is here to stay and has reduced the usage of one-time use straws. More consumers are also bring their lunch boxes and bottles when eating takeout. Thrift shopping is also gaining popularity in Singapore. Young shoppers are seeing the impact of fast fashion on the environment and are not buying from brands such as H&M, Cotton On, Uniqlo, etc. Instead, more are choosing to buy second-hand from shops such as New2U, Refash or the Salvation Army. The use of applications such as Carousell have also made it easier for individuals to buy used clothes. This is not only economical, but also reduces waste generated when one discards old clothes. Individuals are also being encouraged to recycle. Countries like Taiwan, South Korea, Australia, have very high recycling culture and recycle the majority of their waste products. Individuals are also increasingly adopting other practices such as shifting to electric cars or going vegan. With the collective efforts of all individuals, resolving climate change is indeed a possibility. With improvements in green technology, solving climate change will also be possible. Due to the many negative impacts of fossil fuels, renewable energy has arisen as a solution. As its name suggests, renewable energy comes from an infinite source and can last a long time. It is also clean and causes little damage to the environment. The price of renewable energy, such as that of installing solar panels, have fallen significantly in the past few years. Many countries are devoting much of the resources into it. China has installed millions of solar panels, the most in the world, and also invested heavily in hydroelectric dams to provide electricity. Singapore, despite its land scarcity, have also found innovative solutions of installing solar panels on the surface of reservoirs and at the roofs of HDB buildings. Most countries in the world are aiming to change completely to renewable energy in the future. Research is also being conducted for other solutions such as technology to turn carbon dioxide gas emitted to useful energy, vertical farming and other advanced harvesting methods to reduce the strain on land and resources to get the same or even greater yield. Electronic companies are also developing their products to become more energy efficient. Hence, the advancement of technology to create solutions for climate change make resolving it possible. While we may face countless challenges in the fight to solve climate change, as this quote goes, “Be part of the solution, not the pollution”. It is important to hold firmly to the mindset that it is not impossible to solve climate change today. One should do their part to contribute positively to the environment. It may take awhile for the problem to be completely resolved but with the combined hearts and efforts of governments, firms and individuals, we will see change.",Discuss the claim that resolving climate change is impossible today.
Chirin Soh,Raffles Institution,2019,N.A.,"Cities are being submerged by rising sea levels. Thousands of sea turtles and millions of seabirds are washing up ashore due to pollutants in the ocean. The loss of habitat is leading to the extinction of thousands of species. Such are the headlines about the environment that frequently plague our society today. They can be attributed to the rise of consumerism as firms and countries seek to maximise their profits and achieve economic growth. It has led to mass destruction of natural habitats and soaring carbon emission levels so as to gain resources to meet consumption needs. Consumerism has become a curse to our environment as the rising sea levels and erratic climate poses a threat to the sustainability of Mother Earth. Despite these negative impacts, efforts are being done to mitigate the harm to the environment and consumerism can become a blessing instead of a curse. Consumerism can be said to be a curse on the environment because it has led to the prioritisation of economic growth over environmental concerns. Countries that want to achieve economic growth often have to do so at the expense of environmental concerns. This is due to the fact that natural resources such as timber, petrol and gas need to be used to manufacture various goods for sale. It is estimated that Uranium will be completely exhausted by 2030, petrol by 2072 and rare metal by 2087. China is an example of a country that has achieved incredible economic growth in the past decade. However, it is now left with air pollution crisis and contributes nearly 17% of the world’s carbon emissions because these environmental concerns were overlooked previously. Consumerism has further driven up consumption levels, increasing the urge for firms to produce more and at a lower cost to make profits. Developing countries such as Indonesia have palm oil firms that employ the low cost slash and burn method to clear the land for their plantations. It is evident that these firms are only preoccupied with their personal interests of making money. On a larger scale, America has pulled out of the Paris Agreement because it conflicts with their economic agenda. This shows the contrasting nature between consumerism and the environment. Therefore, consumerism has caused negative impacts on the environment. Consumerism has also led to the ubiquitous usage of disposable items which are said to be a curse on the environment. The most common disposable item is plastic bags and it is being handed out at shops freely in many parts of the world. It is only in recent years that greater awareness has been made on its impact on the environment. Plastic is non-biodegradable and increasing plastic waste has led to landfills being very quickly used up. Improper disposal of plastic is also a big problem. Nearly 8 million tonnes of plastic are being dumped into the sea every year. This is equivalent to tipping of one garbage trunk into the sea every minute. Marine life often mistake plastic bags for food and choke on them. There have been many incidents of whales and turtles dying due to ingestion of toxic plastic waste. Consumerism has increased the need for convenience, resulting in this plastic crisis that causes harm and is a curse to the environment. However, increasing awareness on environmental issues and advocacy on environmental concerns is mitigating the harm on the environment, making consumerism less of a curse. More individuals are joining NGOs with the aim of environmental conservation. Through social media or other platforms, more individuals are taking action against companies that employ unsustainable methods of production. The online no straw campaign has taken off. It has influenced many people to stop using disposable straws and opt for metal straws or drink directly from the cup. Firms are also being pushed by the public’s voices to do their part for the environment. In the food and beverage industry, KFC has stopped providing plastic straws in all its 27 outlets across Singapore. Starbucks is also trying this out in several of its stores. The fashion industry is also moving towards environmental sustainability with emerging startups such as Refash and fast fashion brands engaging in practices good for the environment such as trading in of old clothes or making garments using recycled materials. Luxury fashion brand Burberry has also announced that it will stop the use of real fur tnad stop burning its unsold luxury goods. The greater awareness on the threats to our environment has pushed individuals and firms to take more action towards environmental sustainability. Hence, consumerism need not be a curse on the environment. Furthermore, governments are realising the urgency of the problem and are creating policies to ensure that consumerism can coexist with environmental sustainability. Energy demand is increasing in this new age and many developed countries such as Germany and Japan are trying out different technology to get clean, renewable energy. Singapore has pledged to reduce its carbon emissions by 30% by 2030 and has also stopped imports from palm oil firms that use methods harmful to the environment. France has also banned the sale of all disposable cutlery to reduce plastic waste. Similarly, many countries are enforcing the rule that plastic bags have to be of a certain quality or are mandating that stores charge customers for plastic bags. Consumerism can actually become a blessing to the environment instead of a curse as the demand for eco-friendly goods and services can improve the environment. Ecotourism experienced a huge boost in recent years. Its revenue has successfully reduced poverty levels in Costa Rica and protected parts of Thailand. Seeing the success of ecotourism, more countries may prioritise the conservation of these nature trails or areas. Habitats will not be lost and this can help in the conservation of the environment. It is also estimated that billions will be made in revenue through the development of green technology and sustainability. This can further serve as an incentive to firms and countries to take steps towards conserving the environment. To conclude, many of the harmful effects on the environment can be said to be driven by consumerism. Consumerism is likely here to stay for a long time and it is up to the society to dictate whether it becomes a curse on the environment. Often a compromise has to be made between economic growth and environmental conservation but that is not always the case. A balance can be struck and steps are being undertaken to mitigate the effects of consumerism and turn it around to benefit the environment. More has to be done and greater cooperation from all firms and countries is needed to ensure consumerism is not a curse on the environment.",Consumerism is a curse on the environment. Discuss.
Stephanie Heng,Raffles Institution,2019,N.A.,"Albert Einstein once commented: ‘I fear the day that technology will surpass our human interaction. The world will have a generation of idiots’. His comment crystallises the perennial debate as to whether technology aids or retards human and social development. Given the ubiquitous nature of technology and its undeniable effects on individuals, it is therefore imperative to consider the question as to whether technology has alienated people instead of uniting society. While some critics propose the view that technology – in shifting the emphasis from the real world to the digital – has distanced people from one another, preventing them from creating meaningful relationships, I would argue that technology is merely a tool; how it impacts human relationships and social interactions ultimately depends on how the user chooses to wield it. As such, while technology has indubitably alienated people to a certain extent, it has also allowed for greater connections between detached individuals and unifies fragmented societies. It is therefore overly myopic to argue that technology only alienates people.  Some argue that technology has reduced the need for face-to-face communication. This trend has only escalated with the advent of the personal computer, smart devices, and the internet. By immersing one’s self within the digital world, this necessarily reduces time and space for face-to-face interaction, which are fundamental building blocks to constructing lasting human relationships. In Japan, there exists groups of individuals, labelled as ‘otakus’, who devote their entire lives to the digital world and therefore experience extreme fear, anxiety, or detachment when forced to interact within the real world. This demonstrates how technology is therefore detrimental towards the construction of lasting and meaningful human relationships, by damaging the individual’s ability to connect with others socially.  However, this argument assumes that all forms of technology eliminates face-to-face or conventional communication. Contrary to this belief, technology has preserved these conventional methods of communication. Technology has improved such methods and adapted them to different forms. For instance, telephones and mobile phones not only preserve the process of verbal communication but allows anyone anywhere in the world to engage in such verbal communication. This is evident from software such as Skype and Oovoo that seeks to overcome physical distance in order to preserve and strengthen human relationships. As such, certain forms of technology, when used with discretion, connects rather than alienates people.  Opponents to this perspective further argue that technology has made our preferred mode of interacting with the world more impersonal and detached. There is a loss of depth and quality in human interactions. Social media was created with the purpose of maintaining and extending connections with others. Nonetheless, it has arguably had the converse effect. Through social media such as twitter, people now compress their entire day or complex moods into 140 characters. This form of social interaction is further tainted by ulterior motives, as it is geared towards getting the most ‘likes’ or ‘tweets’. Social media therefore turns into a popularity contest, rather than a medium for genuine human interaction. Social applications such as Tinder and Bumble further perpetuates superficiality with regards to human relationships. The effortless swiping past pictures on the application reduces real human beings to their physical appearance, and connections made are often fleeting and superficial. There have been instances of ‘catfishing’, with individuals on such platforms using pictures of attractive people to cheat or scam others. Technology has thus led to the deterioration of human relationships and encouraged deceit.  Nonetheless, this argument assumes that all social media is used for superficial or nefarious reasons. This should not detract from the evidence that have shown that technology has brought people together in more efficient and instant ways. While certain social media may have sacrificed depth, it does not necessarily reduce quality. The two are not mutually exclusive. Often, users find social media a useful way to update their friends and families on monumental events in their lives, or simply their day. Social media has provided us with a platform for instant communication with the people around us, allowing us to gain new insights into the lives of acquaintances whom we otherwise would not have bothered about. Moreover, there have been instances of people finding lasting human relationships through applications such as Tinder. Indeed, romantic relationships aside, there has been an increased use of apps such as BumbleFriend to develop authentic friendships. Just because the relationship was initiated through a technological device or application does not doom it to failure or reduce its worth. Rather, it enables you to connect with people you otherwise would not have met in real life.  Finally, it must be argued that technology has allowed us to grow beyond our insular environment, facilitating our growth into more empathetic human beings capable of understanding the plight others face all around the world. The television for instance allows for the instant dissemination of news and the internet allows us to gain access to perspectives beyond the familiar. If one has an internet connection, one can plug into the virtual stratosphere and gain access to a multiplicity of viewpoints, as well as greater insights as to the happenings around the world. A person in Singapore for instance can have access to online newspapers from countries as diverse as Canada, because of technology.  The use of social media by many politicians and activists around the world, such as America and Singapore, has also successfully encouraged the younger generation to take a stronger interest in political issues, reducing political apathy. This has unified an otherwise detached population group, and youths are more inclined to take ownership in deciding their country’s future. Protestors during the Arab Spring uprising were able to successfully utilise social media and the internet to alert the international community regarding their cause and unify the nation around a common goal. It also served the practical purpose of organising demonstrations, drawing together large, disparate groups of people. Media campaigns for once obscure or otherwise ignored issues, such as PrayforMH370, KONY2012, #MeToo, raises awareness and empathy. This would not have been possible without technology. As such, technology nurtures a self-aware global citizen connected to their society and the world at large.  To conclude, it is overly myopic to demonise technology as the factor leading to the reduction and deterioration of social connections and human relationships. Rather, the user’s intentions and method of usage determines whether technology alienates or unifies. Technology has shown itself capable and full of rich potential for increasing human connections beyond geographical distance, and deepening one’s relationship with each other, society, and the world. Hence, rather than avoiding technology, one should embrace it and learn how to wield it meaningfully to create a more unified community of global citizens.",Technology has alienated people instead of bringing them together.

Stephanie Heng,Raffles Institution,2019,N.A.,"Sun Yat-sen once noted that a ‘civilised nation cannot just have on party; if there were only one party, this would merely be a dictatorship’. Sun Yat-sen’s words raises an important concern relating to the distribution of political power in governance. A party possessing unchecked political power is a startling image for many, and it is therefore necessary to examine the repercussions of such a political act. While the idea of power as being lodged within a single party is tempting, this unlimited power may give rise to corruption, exploitation, and discrimination, leading to ‘bad government’ in that it encourages faulty decision-making processes and under-representation. Political power therefore should be distributed amongst several worthy parties.  Some argue that political power, lodged within one simple party, leads to increased efficacy where governments do not need to contend with needless opposition, especially in times of crisis. During the 2008 Financial Crisis, swift and decisive economic action on China’s part saved the country from further economic burden. The United States on the other hand had to contend with heated debate and long periods of inaction before the $700 billion bailout package was approved. This led to further economic losses that could have been prevented. The resilience package in Singapore was passed quickly due to the lack of debate and contention, allowing the government to tap onto past reserves to tide Singapore through and come of the crisis relatively unscathed. As such, efficacy can be achieved should power be consolidated at the hands of one party.  Concentrating power in the hands of one body also means that the government does not have to resort to populist measures to stay in government or gain entry into the government. During the Asian Financial Crisis, then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong implemented CPF employer contributions from 20% to 10%, reduced burden on companies and firms. This was unpopular, but managed to tide Singapore through a tumultuous period, with Singapore coming out the best in the South East Asian regime. Another example includes the period when Thaksin promised rice subsidies and guaranteed government income in the form of the government buying rice above market prices in order to draw the uneducated rural vote, who only saw the promise of prosperity. This garnered him votes, but was ultimately unsustainable in the long run, as conceded by his sister, Yingluck. The diffusion of power across various parties run the risk of populist politics, which may have detrimental long-term effects on the country’s economy and society.  Nonetheless, humans are fallible creatures and lodging all power in a ruling party would be unwise given that there will be no alternative viewpoint to serve as a system of checks and balances. This can result in unwise decisions made by the government which has long-lasting and disastrous ramifications. Singapore’s disastrous birth control measures in the 1970s and eugenics policy during the 1980s, where the government was unopposed in the implementation of such policies, are a direct cause of the falling birth rate that Singapore is experiencing currently. This was caused by a short-sighted government and inability to see into the future, which led to decisions that was unopposed by any other substantial party. Another example includes China’s Great Leap Forward, which was a misguided and misinformed decision on the part of the government. This led to massive famines and unnecessary suffering for the people. As such, placing all power into the hands of one increases the risk of making serious mistakes, given that there is no alternative or opposing voice to contribute to a sustained and sensible discussion regarding policy implementation.  Moreover, there would be a lack of equal representation in politics, since a single party would only be representative of their own views. This runs the risk of leading to the oppression of minorities and the lack of representation of other interest groups. This is exemplified by theocracies such as Saudi Arabia, who often reject the rights of women shaped by their religious views. There are still no laws against domestic violence and abuse even in the most liberal of the Middle Eastern states. Additionally, Malaysia’s bumiputera policies that serve as essentially affirmative action for the majority, effectively neglects the needs of the only slightly smaller minority. Therefore, lodging all power in one party is to reduce necessary representation and diversity, leading to the oppression of minorities instead.  Finally, by permanently lodging power within one ruling body, in the long run, this results in a general elite-mass divide and disconnect between the government and the proletariat. This is disastrous because the governments are making ill-advised decisions to address the supposed needs of a people they do not even know. The consolidation of power within aristocracy in the Soviet Union led to massive suffering and hardship amongst the people, resulted in general unhappiness and dissatisfaction, and subsequently the Russian Revolution.  To conclude, while the idea of political power as being centralised within one political party is tempting due to its proposed efficacy and determent of populist measures, it is in fact a political system that teeters dangerously close to dictatorship, which may lead to unchecked socio-economic policy disasters and lack of representation within the government. As such, to lodge all power in a single party is to ensure bad government in terms of bad decision-making and political representation.",To lodge all power in one party and keep it there is to ensure bad government.

Stephanie Heng,Raffles Institution,2019,N.A.,"On May 8, 2019, a fake news bill was passed in Singapore to combat the proliferation of online falsehoods. While this controversial bill spurred public debates regarding the potential (ab)use of law to restrict freedom of expression and entrench political power, it is indicative of an underlying concern regarding the truthfulness of both social and mass media. Media in its varied forms has ostensibly infiltrated almost every aspect of our lives and plays an undeniably influential role in shaping the mindsets and perceptions of individuals. Media indubitably involves a selective relation, curation, and representation of information to achieve certain purposes, and this has given rise to the view that the media of today is utterly devoid of truth. Nonetheless, while the media has shown itself to lacking credibility and objectivity, it would be overly myopic to declare that the media does not ever tell the truth. Rather, the instances where the media has become a tool of empowerment in its representation of often disregarded, ignored, or public denied truths demonstrates the potential of the media to be a truthful and essential organ of society.  Certain critics have put forth the view that due to the inherent nature of the media, it lacks objectivity in its representation and communication of information. This is due to a variety of reasons. First, the media as a medium is merely a conduit for the communication of inevitably interpreted information. Media reportage is not just the representation of bare facts but necessarily requires analysis, such as the reportage of the motivations behind policies or the synthesis of information. The choice of what to report or omit within the limitations of space is also affected by human bias. Media is therefore imbued with an inherent subjectivity that lacks objectiveness and accuracy. For instance, German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s economic policies in Germany, represented as a sensible protection of taxpayers’ interests, is given vastly different treatment in Greece, where it is represented as a dictatorial attempt to control sovereign policy. The fact of the matter remains the same, what differs is its analysis.  Information in the media can also be purposefully represented and twisted to achieve political motives. It is well-known that various newspapers have the propensity to be aligned with the predominant views of a select party, whether it be government-controlled state newspapers, or private ones with established political views. Certain newspapers are known to embody certain political leanings, where the New York Times is largely democratic, while the Fox News is mainly Republican. Government controlled censorship in China has given rise to state media that veers towards the territory of state propaganda. To a lesser extent, legal restrictions are imposed on national newspapers in countries such as Singapore. As such, information in the media can be purposefully (mis)represented to fulfil political aims.  Media is also a heavily commercialised industry, and information is often selected and represented towards a view of profit maximisation. This is most evident within the advertising industry, where the selective omission and representation of information misleads consumers into buying a product that is portrayed as better than it actually is. In 2009, an Olay advertisement for its Definity eye cream showed former model Twiggy looking wrinkle-free and younger than her years; however, the advertisements were retouched. This reflects the gross misrepresentation of products.  Nonetheless, I would question the statement that the media never tells the truth. There is still a grain of truth within each piece of information portrayed. Even biased analysis is based to some degree on real-world facts which are available for the reader to peruse. Readers and consumers are not empty vessels blindly absorbing media-based information; rather, they possess faculties of reasoning and rationality that acts as a check against the proliferation of fake news or misrepresented information. Lies are immediately discovered; when Sarkozy attempted to claim that he had participated in the demolition of the Berlin Wall, but journalists and bloggers quickly discovered that he had been in Paris at the time, prompting a rash of mockery. Investigative journalism in particular has the power to expose lies and falsehoods to great effect.  In the past, the domination of a few mainstream news outlets made it easier for a few biased viewpoints to dominate, reducing objectivity. However, the rise of new media makes the gathering, analysing and verifying of information far easier, faster, and objective. The nature of the online community as composed of members from all over the word indicates access to a variety of sources of information available for readers and consumers to evaluate against one another. Now, the introduction of the Internet and new media has enabled the representation of a great variety of perspectives, such as small news sites and blogs to serve niche areas of interest or political beliefs. New media can serve as a useful check on the established viewpoints or dominant biases that would otherwise dominate the media, for example, in Italy where 41% trust online news versus 24% for television news. The rapid dissemination of information on new media forces traditional or mainstream media to reflect more accurate and objective information, as any untruths can be quickly uncovered by the public through verification with the numerous alternative sources available.  While social media is notorious for propagating gross untruths and prejudices, it also has the potential to be a liberating source of truth and empowerment, especially for marginalised communities and groups. The #MeToo movement demonstrates its potential to expose inherent biases and injustices within society. The use of social media in the Egyptian revolution also exemplifies this. By allowing people to express dissatisfaction and turmoil within the country through Facebook, which is a direct expression of truth, media can be a rousing tool to mobilise large groups of people towards liberation and uncover previously unseen realities. As such, the evolution of new media has allowed the flourishing of hidden truths crucial towards the empowerment of disenfranchised and marginalised groups.   To conclude, the media have never been a perfect source of information; its various biases and shortcomings have detracted from its ability to portray reality in an accurate and objective manner. However, these flaws have never been able to completely eradicate the grain of truth present within the media. In particular, the introduction of new media has contributed to ensuring both the accuracy of all information reported and the objectivity of the reporting, vastly increasing the truthfulness and reliability of the media today, as well as strengthening its potential to uncover greater hidden truths and empower consumers and readers with genuine knowledge. Therefore, it cannot be said that the media never tells the truth.",Can the media ever tell the truth?
Stephanie Heng,Raffles Institution,2019,N.A.,"Nuclear energy is often referred to as the energy which is released from the nucleus of an atom, produced when weather fusion or fission occurs in a nuclear reaction. It is a term that conjures up spectres of deformed bodies, irreducible waste, and nuclear anxieties. That said, it is the right and duty of the state to do all in its power to ensure that its people are safe from any external threats. With this in mind, it appears that national nuclear programmes – as controversial as they may be – can actually be justified insofar as they secure a country’s sovereignty and energy independence. While detractors may argue that nuclear programmes cause more harm than good, the potential benefits that a well-regulated national nuclear programme can bring to a country far outweigh the possible negative consequences.  Some may argue that weaponised nuclear programmes have long proven themselves to be destructive to international peace and stability. It is said to be an affront to human rights due to its ability to cause prolonged and unnecessary suffering. Nuclear weapons have extensive long-term effects beyond its immediate destructive capabilities upon detonation, such as radiation sickness, which plagues a population long after its detonation. During World War II, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed nearly 80,000 in Hiroshima and 40,000 in Nagasaki. Damages were not just limited to the physical devastation of the area. Radiation exposure led to unspeakable and excruciating suffering in the form of cancer and physical deformities. We can simply turn to history to see how weaponised nuclear programmes are unjustified insofar as they wreak havoc upon international peace, stability, and general humanity.  Nonetheless, this myopic view fails to consider how nuclear weapons can also act as a deterrent to safeguard national security. This is exemplified through the theory of mutually assured destruction. Historically, the Cold War failed to truly escalate into a full-blown nuclear war because neither country could deal with the widespread destruction that a nuclear war would have wrought. The fear of mutually assured destruction, caused by the knowledge that the other party had in their possession a viable national nuclear programme, ironically prevented the further escalation of the Cold War. The tensions between India and Pakistan is also being stifled through the knowledge that both parties possess nuclear capabilities, and remains one of the strongest factors in preventing an escalation into armed conflict. Therefore, in the context of protecting one’s sovereignty and maintaining equilibrium, national nuclear programmes for the purposes of military use can be justified.  Beyond weaponised national nuclear programmes, national nuclear energy programmes can be justified as well as nuclear energy is one of the most foremost sources of sustainable and environmentally friendly sources of energy. In today’s world, the over-reliance on fossil fuels has resulted in almost irreversible environmental damage. In these times, a sustainable source of energy that does not create the negative consequences of fossil fuels is highly attractive, and even necessary. With the world’s conventional sources of energy being depleted at an astonishing rate, nuclear energy provides a sustainable and renewable alternative, making it a viable choice. In 2011, nuclear energy accounted for roughly 10 per cent of the world’s electricity. Japan, even after the nuclear disaster of Fukushima, has decided to reopen the nuclear reactors, and even has plans to open more. The closure of nuclear reactors had resulted in an increase in the cost of electricity, and more importantly, the doubling of carbon emissions from electricity industries. Previously, nuclear energy had been 30% of all of Japan’s energy. As such, this demonstrates how national nuclear programmes can be justified as a beneficial pursuit for alternative sources of energy. The quest to establish a national nuclear programme is also made ever more pressing due to the rapid depletion of fossil fuels and rising carbon emissions.  Others may argue that such nuclear programmes possess a propensity for disaster with long-term impacts. These include radiation poisoning, the pollution of the environment and its surrounding water bodies. Chernobyl for instance is one of the worst nuclear power plant accidents in history, and its land remains uninhabitable for the next 25000 years. More recent examples include the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, which caused serious concern regarding the radioactive releases to the air and the water leakage from Fukushima Daiichi contaminating surrounding water bodies. As such, due to the devastating repercussions of any nuclear disasters, detractors may argue that this undermines any possible justifications for a national nuclear programme.  Nonetheless, it must be acknowledged that sufficient regulation and the observance of internationally recognised rules and regulations can reduce any chances of disasters occurring to an almost minute level. It has been revealed that the Chernobyl accident occurred as the nuclear scientists deliberately ignored important safety precautions, and constituted a gross violation of the operating code of conduct. Similarly, for Fukushima, the technology in the plant was a good ten years older than that employed in any other Japanese nuclear reactors. One must also consider the presence of international organisations, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), whose sole aim is to properly regulate and monitor the use and operation of nuclear reactors, which helps mediate the chances of similar disasters from occurring again. As such, the potential risks associated with national nuclear programmes can be reduced through careful regulation and adherence to the rules and codes of conducts. This option should not be entirely dismissed solely due to the actions by errant scientists.  To conclude, national nuclear programmes can be justified on the basis that it secures the country’s sovereignty, security, and resource development. It is reductionist to simply state that a national nuclear programme will forever be unjustified; whether it is justified or not lies in the execution of the nuclear programme. A well-executed, regulated programme adhering to the rules and regulations set up by international bodies will serve the country well in securing its borders and energy supply. In such scenarios, the development of a national nuclear programme is indeed justified – and in some cases, necessary.",Can national nuclear programmes ever be justified?
